0,0:28:07.07,0:28:08.27,Default,Julia,0,0,0,,Play that part
0,0:28:08.24,0:28:27.46,Default,Jacob,0,0,0,,"Yeah, I was mainly going on a complaint rant to Julia about how there's a lot of people that watch YouTube game trailers and they seem to have no ability to extrapolate from what they saw in the trailer into what the game will be like. -And so I saw a lot of comments that were like,"
0,0:28:25.04,0:28:25.67,Default,Julia,0,0,0,,Yeah
0,0:28:27.98,0:28:43.88,Default,Jacob,0,0,0,,"Well, what I love about the Souls games is the slow exploration of these areas and like slowly discovering things and playing by myself. But then they say, and I'm worried this new game is not going to have that. And I'm like, it's not going to have that. Did you watch the trailer?"
0,0:28:36.28,0:28:37.13,Default,Julia,0,0,0,,So do I
0,0:28:43.88,0:28:45.85,Default,Julia,0,0,0,,"Yeah, that's not what they're going for, dog"
0,0:28:44.65,0:28:55.69,Default,Jacob,0,0,0,,"We don't have to guess if it's going to have it. It's literally just like, look at what you saw and tell what kind of game it is. Like, I don't know what you're talking about"

0,0:29:58.65,0:30:06.93,Default,Jacob,0,0,0,,Some of the best games ever made are from reused assets which freed up the devs to make some of their best and most exciting and interesting work

0,0:30:07.84,0:30:13.14,Default,Jacob,0,0,0,,"They have so much time to do other stuff. And they already made all these high quality assets, why would you not use them?"
