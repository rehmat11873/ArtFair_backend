54870,56150,Julia,It's okay

63270,64340,Julia,Yeah
63850,65960,Jacob,It's a thing that happens sometimes
65960,69600,Julia,"Well, okay, so especially when you're pregnant,"
70510,71290,Jacob,You're what?
73230,77310,Julia,We keep getting people who are like

90290,91640,Jacob,"Like, do they know?"
91640,92370,Julia,Yeah

98960,101660,Julia,you like very suddenly have to use the bathroom
103080,107060,Jacob,"Yeah, that's true. And sometimes I just have to use the bathroom really suddenly"
107590,108480,Jacob,Just in general
108480,111520,Julia,"Yeah, sorry about that"
111350,113480,Jacob,"When it hits, it hits, you know?"
112770,114490,Julia,I was going to make a whole drink
114590,117730,Jacob,"When it hits, we shits. That's how we do it here"
118810,119640,Julia,Kind of what happened
119400,120870,Jacob,There's no shame in our game
120870,123310,Julia,I'm entering my mullet era
125340,126200,Julia,Don't jud
126200,132220,Jacob,"No, it looks good with like the... you put some product in. -I did, yeah. -Yeah, you got like the slick back. -Yeah. -I think it looks nice"
128870,129490,Julia,"I did, yeah"
130870,134370,Julia,"Yeah. -I think it looks nice. -I was like, I gotta go"
134370,135030,Jacob,Yeah
135570,137020,Julia,So yeah
137840,139800,Jacob,"Because you're trying to grow it back out, right?"
139890,141910,Julia,"Yeah, a little bit"
141320,142030,Jacob,So you can't
144480,145570,Jacob,Short thing
145520,146350,Julia,Short bang
146110,147600,Jacob,A nice short thing
150350,152020,Jacob,"Well, guess what? We're here"
152460,153490,Julia,Yeah
153990,161420,Jacob,"Oh, wait, somebody said that because of my draw class, they were able to set up OBS and try their hand at streaming. Yay!"
159440,161030,Julia,Yeah!
162230,162900,Julia,That's awesome
162900,172270,Jacob,"That is awesome. I'm glad that class was helpful to someone because it's one where like when I was in the middle of it, I was like, I feel like I'm in the weeds here"
172340,173300,Julia,Right
173250,178780,Jacob,"I was like, I feel like I'm really... I forgot going in how much detail there is"
178780,179630,Julia,Yeah
179630,184030,Jacob,"And then I was like, I don't know if anyone's going to, if this is going to mean anything to anyone"
184030,184820,Julia,Yeah
184820,188330,Jacob,But all I can do is continue. I have to keep going to the other side
188740,192890,Julia,"Sometimes when I make a draw class, I"
193580,194980,Julia,I lose
195890,198260,Julia,sight of what I'm supposed to be teaching
200130,209090,Julia,"People are like, hey, can you teach a horror class? And I'm like, yeah, sure. But then I'm like, what is horror? It depends on like the story"
209920,212230,Julia,depends on what you're trying to portray
212230,216130,Jacob,"It's so true, both cats are showing up"
214980,215990,Julia,And I'm like
216520,220030,Julia,"Then I'm like, I guess what they're asking is like body horror, but like"
221210,224920,Julia,"That's not scary to everyone, that's not what was asked, I was asked to do horror"
224680,226810,Jacob,What about emotional horror?
226880,232870,Julia,What about like setting the tension? What about the payoff? -What about establishing a norm and then subverting it?
233850,235400,Julia,I got this jacket
236830,238280,Julia,about 10 years ago
240120,242710,Julia,"uh, from Bass Outlet"
242890,243990,Jacob,Bass
243990,250160,Julia,"Bias. Depends, this is a Kevin James Stanton"
251580,253720,Jacob,I thought you were just going to say Kevin James
253240,254790,Julia,This is a Kevin James
254970,256910,Jacob,It's a Kevin James original
257620,263060,Jacob,"I don't know if y'all know this, but Kevin James, he tables at a lot of small cons and events"
263060,274180,Julia,"This was given to us by some people we were tabling near at Mocha. -It says, be good, do good, and I felt like that's always what I strive for"
275020,283880,Julia,"This one's from some shitty YouTube channel, and then this one's from some show they do on the shitty YouTube channel, so"
284930,285640,Julia,"You know, whatever"
285630,288420,Jacob,Julia loves representing shitty YouTube channels
288060,290290,Julia,"I love it, I have money in this jacket"
290290,291710,Jacob,Money? How much?
292670,293720,Julia,Ten
294410,296200,Jacob,"11, 12"
294430,296380,Julia,"11, 12, 13"
300540,306390,Jacob,That's big sandwich money right there. -You could get a big sandwich for that amount
302310,304670,Julia,That is a big sandwich money
306390,310510,Julia,"Woo! Put that right in my pocket, so I'll forget about it later"
307450,309530,Jacob,"Huge, huge for us"
311080,314690,Julia,"Um, I... someone... some may say"
315270,317830,Julia,that will be done with Silent Hill today
318510,322630,Jacob,"I don't know if that's true or not though. -It's going to be this one or the next one, I think"
322890,325830,Julia,"Well, I wore this outfit in case it was the last one"
327380,332800,Jacob,Did you see that Khaz made the Matrix edit and put it on our YouTube shorts?
332800,333920,Julia,I did not
333810,339940,Jacob,"I didn't know till I was sitting here looking at chat and someone in chat was talking about it and then I went and watched it, it's great"
338990,339580,Julia,I'm scared too
340480,341680,Jacob,Kaz came through
341680,342930,Julia,That's awesome
343180,346230,Jacob,So we have the Morpheus
346960,351410,Jacob,he's beginning to believe at it with James dodging pyramid head
351820,354910,Julia,"Oh, that's great, I'm excited to watch it"
356340,366740,Jacob,"And it's really funny with the seriousness of Morpheus saying he's beginning to believe and then us just like crying, laughing while James just dodges over and over against a wall"
361810,362110,Julia,Yeah
370370,371110,Julia,Yeah
371630,376370,Julia,"Uh, yeah, I was legitimately like crying with laughter"
377000,378740,Julia,"Um, let's get into it, I guess"
378740,380830,Jacob,Y'all play the game
382110,383750,Jacob,Got to unmute this
383750,387000,Julia,It's never a good energy to like run into the stream
388020,389010,Julia,It's like
389750,392540,Jacob,"No, you feel like you weren't like mentally"
392540,395470,Julia,"No, I feel... I feel discombobulated"
395000,396130,Jacob,You feel frazzled
396130,397970,Julia,"I feel frazzled, that's a good word"
398500,403940,Jacob,I feel like I should say too going into this that like I'm like stupid today
405230,410170,Jacob,"I'm just not... I keep making little mistakes today, I keep doing dumb stuff"
410170,416990,Julia,"It's okay, I've been... I keep telling... well, Jacob and I both fell asleep at the same time in different rooms"
419470,426440,Julia,"And then I woke up from my nap and then I was like, immediately, I could go back to bed"
427710,432450,Julia,"I've been playing Dragon Age, so I felt like I could dodge into those barrels"
436160,438250,Jacob,"You can keep going, this doesn't affect you at all"
438370,440820,Julia,"I was wondering if I would have to take over, you know"
442960,444450,Jacob,"Take a... Oh, with the mouse"
444450,445980,Julia,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, since you have Olive"
445980,447300,Jacob,Is it boat time?
447300,448870,Julia,I think I'm supposed to take this bow
448870,450080,Jacob,You're going to take this bag?
450080,453510,Julia,I'm gonna take that boat once I see if there's any ammo here
455250,460410,Jacob,I was thinking today that like lately I feel like for those of you who are
461150,465940,Jacob,"Brandon Sanderson, Stormlight Archive Readers, I have not started the new book yet"
466080,467310,Julia,Road trip
467310,469070,Jacob,"That's a shitty road trip, man"
469660,476150,Jacob,"I've not started the new book yet and this is not a spoiler, but oftentimes I feel like"
477100,477570,Jacob,Um
478250,483390,Jacob,"In that book series, there's a character called Teravangian or Teravangian, I don't know how you pronounce his name"
484190,491900,Jacob,"But one of his whole things is that like some days he wakes up and he's like a super genius and then other days most of the time he wakes up and he's like,"
492620,500690,Jacob,"a dumbass, I've been feeling like him lately, where some days I wake up and I'm like, I'm just stupid today"
501670,506750,Jacob,"And then other days I wake up and I'm like, I'm the smartest man who ever lived, I can do anything"
509470,511440,Jacob,But it's happening less and less
512280,518780,Jacob,"less and less I wake up and feel like the smartest man who ever lived, -and more and more I wake up and feel like a big idiot"
521840,526220,Julia,I was trying to show our sister-in-law something and
527500,535660,Julia,"I was like, I cannot remember where I put this thing. -I was like, my brain's been in the trash and she was like, -Oh, you're never getting it back"
536430,537510,Julia,"I was like, okay, cool"
537510,538860,Jacob,The brain is gone
539010,540380,Julia,Can I run? There we go
541650,544140,Julia,"All right, this is going to be a cutscene, so"
543810,544840,Jacob,"Yeah, yeah, yeah"
545330,546570,Julia,Let's lock in
549140,549980,Julia,It's me
550880,552040,Julia,I'm the bad man
561660,563360,Jacob,I'm on a boat starts playing
584610,585340,Julia,Oh
587410,588560,Julia,Boy
588240,589550,Jacob,Who's ready to paddle?
592510,593570,Julia,Right on
593570,598850,Jacob,the game we were playing where you're in a boat and you're rowing and then like a swamp witch and
600020,603190,Jacob,keeps coming up and trying to get you. -Does that bramble?
601380,602290,Julia,Oh
603190,604170,Julia,Yeah
607850,609670,Jacob,That's not going to happen in this one
608760,609690,Julia,I hear something
632550,634110,Jacob,Isn't there like nothing out here?
636890,638780,Jacob,I'm trying to remember from my
639890,641920,Julia,"Well, we're going to discover that together"
657910,659500,Julia,Just rowing forever
661150,663010,Jacob,I keep hearing little sounds
662940,665370,Julia,"Yeah, it's actually very interesting"
689930,692140,Jacob,"Go towards the light, James"
692880,696510,Jacob,"Do not row parallel to the light, you'll never get there"
698110,700270,Julia,We were going towards it and then it sh
701690,702130,Julia,Oh
734600,735590,Julia,Is my wife here?
736280,737880,Julia,Did my wife row a boat?
740200,742480,Jacob,"She could never rowboat, her arms are too weak"
743610,744420,Julia,She's a woman
749970,752920,Julia,"James must suspect that his wife's not actually here, right?"
754740,758390,Jacob,"Well, at this point, he's been through a lot of supernatural stuff that he is"
758540,759420,Julia,That's true
759010,760990,Jacob,"completely disregarded, so"
761110,762460,Julia,That's a good point
762570,765540,Jacob,"I think he's too in it, he's too lost in the sauce"
765540,769360,Julia,"Yeah, he just has to keep hoping that he can make amends, I guess"
770570,775580,Julia,"It's like, see, I was a good husband, I never gave up. -I followed through on my promise"
778720,780970,Julia,to stand by your
782770,783030,Jacob,No
783840,784490,Jacob,Spend money
786790,788410,Jacob,These waters will bring you peace!
788970,790420,Jacob,Fifteen dollars for the day
792560,795040,Julia,Fifteen dollars to hold to hang? Pretty nice
795190,797570,Jacob,"Yeah, but how long realistically am I going to"
798330,799630,Jacob,be rowing around out there
799530,801220,Julia,"Well, you can take it to go fishing"
803070,806080,Jacob,"You could take it to Go Vision, count me out"
807310,813330,Julia,I actually like fishing. -I like sitting on a boat. -I don't like the act of
814010,815360,Julia,herding of fish
815730,818190,Jacob,"No, I will sit on the boat, that's for sure"
817500,818350,Julia,"Yeah, yeah"
819930,820740,Jacob,Puddle
820810,824280,Julia,I like that you can see the building more clearly in the puddle than you can
824280,825580,Jacob,That is interesting
825900,827370,Julia,Like there's someone there
828270,829090,Julia,Or is that a phone?
829100,831150,Jacob,I think it's a... a false
831150,832100,Julia,Affonse
834120,836860,Julia,Falls! Falls!
839120,840840,Julia,Let's see if there's anything over here
844740,847170,Jacob,Very well landscaped over here
847350,850290,Julia,"It's beautiful, flowers are thriving"
850420,851980,Jacob,"Well, it's very humid, so"
852060,854750,Julia,That's true
857550,861900,Jacob,Is there a way to make the achievement volume louder?
863570,866080,Julia,I feel like I wasn't notified clearly enough
866090,868430,Jacob,I'd really like to crank that up if I could
868430,872620,Julia,"I can still hear other things, so I feel like"
874730,876430,Julia,I feel like we can make it louder
883740,885790,Julia,"Oh, it's my flashlight. I thought I saw a little"
886910,894180,Jacob,"Dude, put me right there in those two chairs, not those, left those. -That's me and you right there"
894180,895630,Julia,"Oh yeah, 100%"
895360,896870,Jacob,Absolutely chilling
896870,903510,Julia,"and then we're like, oh, this is amazing, and then we put in an order for food, and then we start being slightly inconvenienced by bugs"
903510,906650,Jacob,"Yeah, and then we're like, never mind, outside was a mistake"
908090,909100,Julia,"Wait, what?"
910250,911230,Jacob,No items
915270,916320,Jacob,They got the
916270,917670,Julia,How does this chain work?
917670,920200,Jacob,"It's lots of different chains, OK?"
920090,923220,Julia,"No, it's like all linked together, is one chain"
924560,925050,Julia,Cacao!
929160,934060,Jacob,"As the cold draws near, they abandon their old nests to return in time"
934700,935580,Julia,Hmm
936120,937450,Julia,That's James right there
943960,944440,Julia,Oh
947070,948270,Jacob,Rotten apple
948270,950020,Julia,I'm really glad that the
950830,951660,Julia,Sound effect half
951610,952920,Jacob,Made like a squish
952670,953310,Julia,Yeah
955100,958980,Julia,"I'm the rotten apple, it's me. Oh yeah, put that in your pocket"
957830,958150,Jacob,Do you
958750,960650,Jacob,"James, why are you keeping that, bro?"
960650,964480,Julia,"Because it's gross, he only deserves the grossest things, okay?"
964480,968360,Jacob,"I was going to say you should throw that thing as hard as you can against a tree, it's really fun"
969950,974840,Jacob,"Lone one of the east, out of the water safety now lost out of breath"
979280,981260,Jacob,Why'd you go out of the water? You're a fish
982400,984480,Julia,Lone one of the east
986610,991230,Julia,"I can't loan the east, that's too big. -And I don't own it"
989850,992500,Jacob,This has got to be some Puzz shit
992990,994490,Julia,"Yeah, oh yeah"
994490,996060,Jacob,This is some major puz

1064890,1067200,Jacob,"Do I know what your birthday is, the one you just said?"
1070780,1072920,Julia,"Yeah, do you know?"
1072920,1075670,Jacob,"If I didn't know before, I definitely do now"
1075670,1077020,Julia,"Well, what is it then?"
1077020,1078740,Jacob,"Oh shit, oh no"
1079230,1080330,Julia,"Oh my God, it's the same"
1082200,1085050,Jacob,"No, I told you, I've got the perfect mnemonic device for your birthday"
1085050,1086080,Julia,"Okay, what is it?"
1086080,1087490,Jacob,March one two
1087920,1090030,Julia,"Oh, okay, how'd you know?"
1090930,1091400,Julia,I just
1091400,1096400,Jacob,"I'll never forget because it's like someone marching. -They're like, march, one, two, one, two"
1097420,1098590,Jacob,I'll never forget
1099150,1105190,Julia,"Well, I super remembered your birthday after you pointed out that it's-- -That it's 69"
1102840,1104240,Jacob,That it's 6'9
1107090,1108750,Julia,"Oh, the rotten apple didn't work here"
1108750,1110350,Jacob,"Yeah, it's a hard one to forget"
1110350,1111650,Julia,Look at this good ceiling
1111650,1113350,Jacob,That is a good ceiling
1113570,1124240,Julia,Do you know that ceilings like that were originally in the Duomo and it was a way of making a domed ceiling that was lighter?
1125840,1127140,Jacob,like lighter in weight
1128050,1130570,Julia,So that it wouldn't collapse under its own weight
1130570,1131310,Jacob,Yeah
1131290,1134630,Julia,"So they made this, they invented that kind of ceiling for that building"
1135970,1137640,Julia,"Well, let's investigate the piano"
1138500,1142380,Jacob,"You ever noticed how if you say Duomo, it sounds like you're doing baby voice?"
1142380,1143240,Julia,Yeah
1142950,1143980,Jacob,Dwellmo
1144880,1146600,Jacob,Do you want to go to the Duomo?
1147020,1147700,Julia,Yeah
1147700,1149250,Jacob,I want to see the Duomo
1149250,1150930,Julia,I'm going to probably
1150290,1152180,Jacob,"OK, fine"
1154510,1155470,Jacob,Dwellmo
1158530,1159710,Julia,Do we think it's
1160670,1161450,Julia,Maria?
1163080,1163860,Julia,Hello?
1164740,1167740,Jacob,"I want you to know that if a cut scene started, I would stop talking"
1168130,1169890,Julia,"Well, I didn't want to cut you off"
1171130,1172330,Jacob,Intermezzo
1173650,1175400,Jacob,Johanes Brahms
1176650,1177680,Julia,Grames
1177680,1181360,Jacob,"I had no good way to mispronounce Brahms, it's spelled exactly like it sounds"
1180820,1182270,Julia,The Hames!
1182740,1185760,Jacob,"I said no good way to mispronounce it, oh"
1186730,1188840,Julia,Someone disagrees with you
1189410,1189870,Julia,Laura?
1190120,1190780,Jacob,Yeah
1190780,1191380,Julia,You did
1193050,1198880,Julia,"Laura's like, James is like, oh God. -Someone else to trauma dump on me"
1199580,1203210,Julia,"Then again, maybe you're not so bad, just"
1204340,1206390,Julia,Annoying. -That's fair
1207570,1208020,Julia,So
1219750,1222230,Julia,I think you've had enough... for now
1222890,1223530,Jacob,Wow
1224380,1228290,Julia,That's reassuring
1228910,1229840,Julia,She's here
1230550,1231280,Julia,Isn't she?
1232850,1234280,Julia,"Come on, tell me"
1235820,1236810,Jacob,I wish I knew
1237940,1238530,Julia,But
1239730,1241060,Julia,She said it in her letter
1245940,1247290,Julia,So there really is a letter
1249130,1249870,Julia,Oh
1250700,1251390,Julia,Yeah
1252500,1253310,Julia,Wanna read it?
1256220,1256980,Julia,Just
1257840,1259260,Julia,"Don't tell Rachel, OK?"
1259320,1261260,Jacob,Just says fuck you in it
1261750,1262820,Julia,She's our nurse
1263760,1264620,Julia,I
1265620,1266460,Julia,I took it from her locker
1316650,1317020,Julia,
1318540,1319010,Julia,I love you
1354460,1355170,Julia,All right
1357350,1358160,Jacob,How old are you?
1360880,1361570,Julia,Last week
1365530,1366180,Jacob,"Yeah, I mean"
1385460,1387320,Julia,"James, think about it like a little harder"
1390360,1392030,Julia,She even showed me all her pictures
1394100,1395600,Julia,She really wanted to come back
1397020,1399670,Julia,"She also talks a lot about you, you know?"
1400770,1401510,Julia,Seven
1404230,1404850,Jacob,What?
1406140,1406980,Jacob,What is it?
1408230,1408830,Julia,Well
1409810,1411370,Julia,It kind of was his other letter
1412290,1413590,Julia,I think the warmer's for you
1422420,1423530,Julia,Wanted to
1424290,1426250,Julia,"This one time, I almost dead"
1427530,1428760,Julia,You didn't deserve to have it
1430280,1430620,Julia,But then
1438940,1439480,Julia,Yeah
1448590,1450430,Julia,Just says I know what you did last summer
1451720,1452760,Jacob,three years ago
1452760,1455020,Julia,"three years ago, last, last, last summer"
1455630,1456360,Julia,It's empty
1457540,1461060,Julia,Get rekt
1464340,1465060,Julia,Wait
1465250,1465530,Jacob,Sit down
1469820,1470330,Julia,I gotta find it
1471040,1471580,Jacob,Laura!
1479590,1480400,Julia,Well
1481650,1491350,Jacob,"I did love the person in chat who was saying,  James, honey, you jumped into your own grave and ended up outside of a lake house. Like think about it a little bit"
1491350,1495340,Julia,"Yeah, yeah, ads are going to start soon, so we might as well just like"
1495400,1502310,Jacob,But James is not experiencing things in a lucid state of mind. He's in like a psychedelic dream dimension
1502310,1503520,Julia,"Yeah, yeah"
1503880,1509830,Jacob,"I mean, it's like when you're having a dream, everything makes sense to you even though it's all nonsense"
1510220,1511220,Julia,Yeah
1511220,1513140,Jacob,That's kind of what James is experiencing
1513140,1514610,Julia,I'm going to run the ads
1514680,1517210,Jacob,",OK, you don't want me to talk this stream, I get it"
1517810,1519050,Julia,"Ellie, you just have bad timing"
1518890,1523310,Jacob,"Every time I start talking, you're like, -let's have you stop talking"
1520160,1522070,Julia,I just said I was going to run the ad
1523280,1525850,Julia,And then you went on
1525410,1528610,Jacob,Let's have you stop talking and then we can do something else
1528530,1531450,Julia,I said I was going to run the ads and then you just wouldn't shut the fuck up
1535300,1538820,Jacob,I just thought we could have like a moment of conversation while we waited for the ads to start
1539620,1544730,Jacob,I thought we could kind of digest what was happening in the game and the story for a second
1544000,1545620,Julia,"No, I like it"
1545620,1546920,Jacob,Clearly you didn't like it
1546870,1548140,Julia,I just like
1549710,1555820,Julia,"With these last streams of games, it's always like we can go a little long, so I'm just trying to like"
1556340,1559480,Julia,play the game and do the yapping at the same time
1559410,1563360,Jacob,"Oh, I'm sorry, I thought we were enjoying ourselves on stream"
1562520,1564270,Julia,Of being efficient
1564190,1568560,Jacob,I thought we were having a nice time talking to each other in the chat
1568560,1574090,Julia,"We keep getting comments that are like, this is not the optimal way to play the game"
1574770,1576840,Julia,"Today, optimal"
1576810,1578940,Jacob,"Optimal, we're locking in"
1577420,1577940,Julia,Optimal!
1580720,1585620,Jacob,"We're speed running the rest of this. -If you skip the cut scenes, it goes a lot faster actually"
1585470,1586560,Julia,"Oh, we might as well"
1586340,1587170,Jacob,Yeah
1587240,1588330,Julia,Just finish it
1589130,1592860,Jacob,Somebody asked me to talk about the new Elden Ring
1589230,1590330,Julia,Who cares about the story?
1593470,1596130,Jacob,"I think it looks super sick, I'm really excited about it"
1598070,1599660,Jacob,it's pretty much just like
1601560,1608200,Jacob,"It looks like they're just like,  how can we take all this shit we made and then put it in a package that's just like maximum fun?"
1608200,1609260,Julia,Yeah
1609510,1615200,Jacob,get your friends together and let's fucking speed run Elden Ring
1615200,1616060,Julia,Yeah
1615890,1616750,Jacob,And
1617650,1620600,Jacob,and fight bosses from like the whole Souls series
1620680,1621810,Julia,Yeah
1622590,1625160,Jacob,I'm psyched about it. I think it's going to be a really good time
1630390,1645170,Jacob,"Yeah, as my mistake said,  hey, people modded our game, let's do it ourselves, actually, that's exactly what I said to Julia. I was like, clearly they looked at all of the top mods that everyone loved for Elden Ring and they were like, let's just take all the top mods and put all of them into one game"
1635430,1636210,Julia,"Yeah, that is"
1646270,1649150,Julia,"Yeah, the other thing that we were talking about, not to like"
1650060,1652040,Julia,bring down the hype
1652040,1653250,Jacob,"Oh, here we go"
1654770,1656860,Jacob,She's going to tell me to stop talking again
1657400,1660860,Julia,"but I really got to play this game, so I appreciate if you can lock the fuck in"
1661910,1663550,Julia,"No, um"
1664120,1672030,Julia,"It's that I love, so there's like a thing that happens on the internet and the internet's like a big place, so you're going to get a lot of"
1673370,1685770,Julia,"viewpoints and stuff like that, and then it's easy to cherry pick the worst ones and then say that's everyone. But we were laughing about the comments that were like, but my favorite part about Elden Ring isn't represented here, and it's like, so play Elden Ring"
1687070,1688270,Julia,Play that part
1688240,1707460,Jacob,"Yeah, I was mainly going on a complaint rant to Julia about how there's a lot of people that watch YouTube game trailers and they seem to have no ability to extrapolate from what they saw in the trailer into what the game will be like. -And so I saw a lot of comments that were like,"
1705040,1705670,Julia,Yeah
1707980,1723880,Jacob,"Well, what I love about the Souls games is the slow exploration of these areas and like slowly discovering things and playing by myself. But then they say, and I'm worried this new game is not going to have that. And I'm like, it's not going to have that. Did you watch the trailer?"
1716280,1717130,Julia,So do I
1723880,1725850,Julia,"Yeah, that's not what they're going for, dog"
1724650,1735690,Jacob,"We don't have to guess if it's going to have it. It's literally just like, look at what you saw and tell what kind of game it is. Like, I don't know what you're talking about"
1735690,1736600,Julia,Yeah
1737730,1739150,Julia,It's like
1741340,1742690,Julia,"Yeah, I don't know"
1743350,1747090,Julia,"It's just like I understand where people are coming from, like I"
1748460,1758600,Julia,",Well, like, I think that if you're a very particular kind of Zelda fan, and this is related, you like some of the games, but not the other games, and then if you're another kind of fan, you love, you know"
1759350,1764340,Julia,"the other games more than the first kind of games and it's like, but it's like kind of"
1765440,1769810,Julia,"They're playing around with it, you know? It's fun, it's a toy"
1770740,1773400,Julia,",Something for everyone, what's on your nose?"
1773590,1776540,Jacob,And I wanted to draw attention also to the fact that
1776590,1777890,Julia,Can I get it off your nose?
1779230,1783270,Jacob,I also saw people complaining about like asset reuse in the game
1784250,1798090,Jacob,"And the first thing I thought of was like, -you better not be one of those motherfuckers who's like, -Majora's Mask is my favorite game or Fallout New Vegas is my favorite game. -If you're then going to come in here and be like, they're reusing assets, I'll kill you"
1793080,1793800,Julia,Yeah
1798650,1806930,Jacob,Some of the best games ever made are from reused assets which freed up the devs to make some of their best and most exciting and interesting work
1807270,1807930,Julia,Yeah
1807840,1813140,Jacob,"They have so much time to do other stuff. And they already made all these high quality assets, why would you not use them?"
1814270,1815200,Julia,Yeah
1815350,1816530,Jacob,"Sorry, go ahead, James"
1823270,1824500,Jacob,"Go ahead, James, get it"
1824500,1826100,Julia,Is it Mary's theme?
1827710,1828330,Julia,Right?
1844360,1845120,Julia,Yeah
1846150,1847640,Julia,"I like that, that's fun"
1847920,1851840,Jacob,This game's unrealistic because he didn't immediately play the rugrats theme
1852500,1856040,Jacob,"On piano, that's the one you play if you don't know how to play piano"
1858540,1859430,Julia,Yeah
1861290,1862000,Julia,I'm
1864590,1866320,Julia,trying to remember the rubber ass theme
1866380,1875060,Jacob,"Dun dun dun dun dun dun, dun dun dun dun dun, dun dun dun dun dun, dun dun dun dun dun, dun dun dun dun dun"
1868390,1868880,Julia,Oh
1870260,1870860,Julia,"Yeah, yeah"
1876900,1894020,Julia,"Laura, it's cool, I don't deserve letters from my dead wife, it's okay. Also, I did like in chat, and this is not a call out because this game is very confusing and a lot of things are not literal, but someone was like, oh, Mary's actually dead, and I was like, yeah, yeah"
1894020,1894820,Jacob,Yeah
1894720,1898770,Julia,"Yeah, yeah, no, she's dead for real"
1899170,1901530,Jacob,"She been dead, she done been dead"
1900290,1901350,Julia,She been dead
1904100,1905420,Julia,"Oh, there's a save point"
1906280,1907240,Julia,Don't mind if I do
1911140,1915200,Julia,"but again, I completely understand why there's some confusion"
1916170,1922510,Jacob,",Mr. James Sunderland, regarding the videotape you left in your room during your last stay, ew, gross, icky,"
1922510,1925360,Julia,"Ewe, ewe, ewe, I watched it"
1923250,1924430,Jacob,"Ew, ew, ew"
1925040,1926590,Jacob,Why did you leave that there?
1926390,1927460,Julia,Gross
1927460,1936420,Jacob,I'm glad to inform you that we've recovered the item and moved it to the employee section on the first floor. The tape is stored within the hotel safe to be returned to you at your earliest convenience. Please pick it up
1937240,1940330,Jacob,"Now, I don't want it here anymore"
1942410,1943930,Julia,I do not want it
1946250,1947430,Jacob,Music books
1947440,1948500,Julia,There's the
1948430,1949610,Jacob,312
1949610,1950690,Julia,You're 12
1955690,1957440,Julia,Someone said spoilers
1959670,1964760,Julia,"Listen, we jumped into our own grave and wound up at a lake"
1968930,1969980,Julia,Mary's dead
1969980,1972680,Jacob,You go jump into your own grave and see what happens
1980000,1981810,Jacob,"Well, well, what the fuck?"
1983610,1984160,Julia,"Oh, you know"
1984160,1986010,Jacob,What the hell kind of contraption is this?
1986010,1987970,Julia,"It's a music box, you dumbass"
1987970,1989320,Jacob,"No, it isn't"
1997620,1998630,Julia,"Oh, and dusty"
2000590,2001330,Julia,Give me this
2002560,2003220,Julia,Oh
2004070,2004490,Julia,",Mm"
2004490,2006330,Jacob,That's a staff only room
2006330,2007830,Julia,"Oh, yeah, that's why I can't go home"
2014560,2016180,Julia,"102, we'll take that"
2022000,2024300,Julia,"Well, the hotel needs renovations anyway"
2024980,2027440,Jacob,Break on through to the other side
2028080,2030530,Julia,I like that they definitely wanted me to follow
2031070,2032530,Julia,"Laura, and I was like,"
2033060,2034370,Julia,time to look for items
2037310,2039550,Jacob,What Laura doesn't realize is that we're gaming
2039820,2041510,Julia,"Yeah, yeah"
2049060,2049980,Julia,guitar
2054190,2055150,Jacob,Go ahead
2055920,2056870,Jacob,buckaroo
2057710,2059720,Julia,Remember that strange book you found earlier?
2060280,2067030,Julia,"some very odd looking man came in a few hours back, claimed to belong to him. Honestly, I didn't feel like arguing"
2071630,2073830,Julia,I'm not sure how he even knew it was here
2074520,2077410,Julia,"I don't think he was ever a guest here, I would have remembered"
2080700,2088040,Jacob,"I just can't get it out of my head. Girl, your eyeballs are all I think about"
2082350,2084050,Julia,♪ Get it out of my head. ♪
2089250,2091260,Julia,"On Ironically, a song"
2092240,2093450,Julia,That gets stuck in my head
2094970,2096610,Julia,as probably designed
2096930,2101500,Jacob,"I thought you were just going to say  unironically a song. -I was going to be like, that is so true"
2101200,2103010,Julia,"Ironically, a song"
2102550,2104540,Jacob,"Unironically, that is a song"
2105520,2108090,Jacob,Literally not even joking
2106600,2109270,Julia,"Literally, he's a song"
2112100,2112740,Julia,Laura?
2115380,2115930,Julia,Well
2116980,2118290,Julia,We don't have to be like this
2118290,2119750,Jacob,The gurgler is here
2120050,2121160,Julia,"Well, I gotta"
2122870,2124340,Julia,key from 102
2124520,2126430,Jacob,"James, you're going to get gurgled, bro"
2130560,2133460,Jacob,"James, you got gurgled, bro. I freaking warned you"
2136910,2138090,Jacob,I told you
2140030,2142410,Julia,"James was told about the tape and he was like,"
2143150,2144990,Julia,All I can think about are legs again
2150930,2151610,Julia,Yoink
2154120,2155470,Julia,"Okay, 102"
2155620,2158240,Jacob,Is Laura a real person? You tell me
2158240,2160280,Julia,"You tell me, buckaroo"
2163570,2164310,Julia,It's like a vent
2164310,2165880,Jacob,You tell me what you think
2167370,2169900,Jacob,"I want to hear your theories, chat"
2172160,2174080,Jacob,I know she's a video game character
2174320,2176530,Julia,"Damn, though"
2175250,2177090,Jacob,"Fuck, that's true"
2183380,2184210,Julia,I was ready
2186860,2187680,Julia,I'll take that
2188360,2189220,Julia,I'll take that
2191680,2192560,Julia,I'll take that
2195970,2200950,Jacob,We're kind of all video game characters if you think about it because the universe is a simulation
2200950,2201620,Julia,Yeah
2202420,2206550,Jacob,"I did mushrooms once, so I know that that's true"
2208170,2215510,Julia,I did mushrooms once and it made me think about my size relative to the world because I've never thought about that independently before
2220610,2222580,Jacob,"Damn, we got the balcony view"
2224960,2226610,Julia,I'm ready to shoot
2227750,2229790,Julia,Now this is a delightful spot
2230800,2238760,Jacob,"I will say though, if my balcony is like directly next to my neighbor's balcony and there's not a wall there, my ass is not going out there"
2236520,2236940,Julia,Yeah
2238980,2239520,Julia,Yeah
2239340,2241770,Jacob,"Because I'm at risk, I might have to talk to them"
2242220,2244990,Julia,I'm at risk for forced socialization
2248800,2249670,Julia,So I'll do that
2253720,2255170,Julia,Why'd you... huh
2256870,2258760,Julia,What? Why are we hunting?
2259770,2265140,Jacob,",Draz said,  ,Hmm, fanfic prompt. That's actually a good setup"
2263670,2265170,Julia,Yeah
2266020,2267940,Julia,forced shared balcony
2269730,2271670,Julia,I actually read a manga like that
2271670,2284060,Jacob,"You could have the one character who's really like shy and introverted and doesn't want to socialize, but they accidentally lock themselves on the balcony and out comes the social butterfly talkative neighbor"
2284850,2287450,Jacob,"Oh boy, odd couple situation"
2288560,2292010,Julia,"Yeah, I read one, it was a guy who used his outside"
2293100,2298200,Julia,"OK, outside balcony is like a little garden space and then his next door neighbor"
2299720,2300260,Julia,Um
2300970,2309660,Julia,"just like moved in or something. I read this a while ago, so I can't remember, but... ...then they started talking because of his beautiful garden space"
2311800,2313100,Julia,Who's squelching out there?
2314090,2315310,Julia,Reveal yourself
2315310,2318620,Jacob,"Whenever somebody types WLW,"
2319760,2324290,Jacob,"in describing a fic or manga or something, I always read it as"
2324290,2325170,Julia,Oh!
2326360,2328190,Jacob,"And then there's of course, Mlem"
2328240,2330840,Julia,"Wooloo, wooloo"
2330880,2333650,Jacob,Do you read Mlem or
2335100,2336570,Jacob,Which is your favorite?
2337380,2338530,Jacob,Whoa!
2345420,2346210,Julia,Just fucking
2349840,2351090,Julia,standing there
2354480,2355640,Julia,"All right, weirdo"
2361780,2364110,Julia,"home office romance, is that what it was called?"
2364650,2367880,Julia,Wasn't one of them like an archaeologist who wanted to like travel or something?
2370100,2370810,Julia,It was cute
2371740,2374320,Julia,"All right, you're about to bust into an interpretive dancer"
2376230,2378660,Julia,"You know when they start to fold it up and they're like,"
2378830,2379600,Jacob,Yeah
2379600,2384290,Julia,That's my impression of interpretive dance. That's my interpretation of interpretive dance
2385680,2387530,Julia,It's an interpretation of interpretation
2387870,2391470,Jacob,"That's meta interpretive dance, post interpretive dance"
2391350,2393460,Julia,"I was about to say, that's like an art movement"
2393460,2394390,Jacob,Fuck
2395010,2395420,Julia,F
2396660,2397710,Julia,I'm
2399620,2400660,Julia,Crafty
2401740,2405730,Julia,I'm ahead of the time. -I wasn't expecting to be able to open that
2407030,2408590,Julia,Us actually crisis?
2408680,2418520,Jacob,"I wanted to say to chat also, because somebody said they caught up on  Marianetta and they don't know what to read now. -I'm also caught up on Marianetta, except for like the, you know, paid chapters"
2419160,2425650,Jacob,"It's so good, man. -But it reminded me there was a new comic that just started coming out on Webtoon that's really cute"
2425650,2429790,Julia,"Oh, is it the cozy one that you were... that I started reading?"
2427160,2428880,Jacob,It's the cozy one
2429790,2437060,Jacob,It makes me think of like a comic version of like a Stardew Valley-esque scenario. -It's called Little Hollow Cafe
2437690,2444960,Jacob,about a woman who moves to a small town to run a cafe and then meets all of the other people that work and live there
2446070,2453150,Jacob,really cute art style. -It feels like a Stardew Valley game that you're reading
2453150,2455810,Julia,"Yeah, yeah, it's really cute"
2455810,2459880,Jacob,"It's on Webtoons, super cute so far, and it's just started, so"
2459880,2462780,Julia,I want to talk about the environmental storytelling of this room
2462780,2463540,Jacob,Yes
2464320,2472420,Julia,"bottle, a bunch of like blood stains, just cigarettes like literally everywhere. It's great"
2473090,2479770,Julia,"um, the damp carpet, like the worn carpet with like the footprints that I didn't leave"
2481110,2486510,Julia,"more staining over here from this bottle. Like, look at... there's more cigarettes over there"
2490620,2491970,Jacob,There's this
2492580,2494340,Julia,"There's that, um"
2495030,2497410,Julia,I love the fingerprints in the dust
2499770,2503630,Julia,"more cigarettes, blood or wine or something like"
2504510,2506620,Julia,someone down in this room and it wasn't good
2506620,2507470,Jacob,No
2508600,2511300,Julia,"There's like alcohol everywhere, there's a vase on the floor"
2512700,2514270,Julia,The carpet's all moldy
2514270,2518990,Jacob,You don't want to be in this room. -You don't want to be around the person who was in this room
2519090,2520090,Julia,No
2526360,2529000,Jacob,That's how I enter the bathroom every time I have to pee
2529590,2532640,Julia,That's apparently how I entered the bathroom when I dislocated my knee
2534670,2537170,Julia,"because I thought I entered it normally, but"
2538260,2538950,Julia,You know?
2539550,2542950,Julia,You think you enter a room normally and then your knee is somewhere else?
2543050,2544370,Jacob,That'll happen sometimes
2544250,2545350,Julia,That'll happen
2546480,2552710,Jacob,"This is extremely narrowcasting to Marionetta readers, but PeachyLove asked me Team Sahed or Tani"
2553450,2556760,Jacob,",And you don't even have to ask that question to me, you know I'm Team Sahed"
2559420,2560440,Jacob,He's too hot
2561080,2564370,Jacob,He's too hot to be ignored and he's unhinged
2567690,2569530,Julia,Those legs were just walking around
2570050,2572100,Julia,And I like followed them and killed them
2573770,2574850,Julia,What's-what happens?
2579690,2581600,Julia,"Oh, speaking of which, I"
2583990,2587320,Julia,"I got in Dragon Age, I just got Tosh"
2588620,2589820,Julia,It was very fun
2590220,2591440,Jacob,Daniel Tosh?
2592770,2594080,Jacob,from Tosh.0
2594940,2595760,Julia,Uh-huh
2596090,2601410,Jacob,"It's a crazy twist in the game. -Daniel Tosh shows up and you're like, -I don't want to play this game anymore"
2602640,2605310,Jacob,Are you going to be here the whole time?
2602690,2605220,Julia,Suddenly I find this game irritating
2607360,2609980,Jacob,"Sorry, please continue talking about Tosh"
2610820,2612040,Julia,Daniel Tosh?
2612710,2614340,Julia,Sun room!
2616190,2618500,Julia,"Anyway, Tasha's great"
2621560,2626890,Julia,Hedera Helix seems to have some kind of pest separate from the rest of the plants
2627800,2628960,Julia,"Oh, separate"
2630720,2632800,Julia,separate from the rest and plants are little die out
2632800,2635340,Jacob,I read it the same way in your defense
2634620,2635870,Julia,"OK, thank you"
2641760,2642230,Julia,What?
2643430,2644490,Julia,What's the point of this room?
2645550,2647610,Julia,Bullets! That's the point of this room
2649210,2654430,Julia,"Um, yeah, Tash is fun. I think my favorites right now though are"
2655380,2657820,Julia,Um... Lucanus?
2659310,2661770,Julia,and Nev
2662610,2664350,Julia,But Tosh is up there
2665970,2668150,Julia,I don't love Emmerich
2669360,2670260,Julia,He's fine
2673620,2679780,Julia,"He's fun. I like... actually, my favorite companions are Manfred and Asan"
2680870,2682380,Jacob,And they're not even companions
2682380,2684820,Julia,"No, those are my favorite characters though"
2686750,2693340,Julia,"Someone said incredibly loud, incorrect buzzer. -Yeah, I feel like my Emmerich opinions are"
2694340,2696550,Julia,"Unwelcome, and I accept that"
2699170,2701980,Jacob,"You misread, that person said incredibly correct buzzer"
2702400,2704990,Julia,"Oh, well, I accept that too"
2703760,2705970,Jacob,They were giving you a supportive buzzer
2705780,2708600,Julia,"Thank you, thank you, thank you, I appreciate that"
2709800,2710890,Julia,When did this get here?
2711860,2712780,Julia,Has this been here?
2712780,2713900,Jacob,I think it's been there
2713960,2714660,Julia,Really?
2718910,2719430,Julia,Whoops
2721440,2722150,Julia,Okay
2727230,2730130,Julia,What do we have? We have keys for like a sunroom
2731460,2733670,Jacob,Manfred is voiced by Matthew Mercer
2734720,2735430,Julia,Really?
2735430,2736440,Jacob,"He just goes,"
2738670,2741030,Jacob,Did they pay Matthew Mercer to go?
2741740,2742970,Julia,Did they pay him to
2743770,2747530,Julia,to just make noises. How much did they pay him his usual cut?
2749960,2752590,Julia,to just like squelch into a mic
2753000,2754870,Jacob,They should have paid Julia to do that
2754870,2758180,Julia,"I love to make those noises, it's so funny"
2759810,2761650,Julia,"Employee section, oh"
2762160,2765860,Julia,"We didn't do the employee section, right?"
2766550,2767960,Julia,"Oh, no, because I can't go in"
2768960,2771090,Jacob,"Yeah, it's employees only, like"
2771090,2772610,Julia,Can we go through the restaurant?
2772340,2773900,Jacob,"Sorry, are you an employee?"
2774390,2775220,Julia,You're right
2775840,2777380,Julia,punched that door open
2779390,2779730,Julia,Oh
2784470,2785300,Julia,"Okay, no"
2787470,2789900,Julia,"No, it would be through there. Okay"
2790920,2792840,Julia,"All right, that's fine, whatever"
2794240,2795450,Julia,Frickin... what?
2796420,2796860,Julia,Man
2797060,2799710,Jacob,Somebody said they paid Vin Diesel to say I am Groot
2800210,2802830,Jacob,"That's true, but he said it in a lot of different ways"
2804520,2819200,Jacob,"And I don't know, I'm pretty sure they didn't use him for Marvel Rivals, -but whoever they use is getting a lot of screen time. -Because I am Groot fucking... -If Groot's on your team, that's all you hear the whole game. -He won't shut the fuck up about how he's Groot"
2819350,2822300,Julia,"Yeah, I wish you would chill"
2823720,2826220,Julia,"to be fair, freaking Tandy's like,"
2827360,2829420,Julia,It's so cold
2838170,2840220,Julia,Cloak and dagger is still my favorite to play
2841560,2844090,Julia,"I do laugh at everything Tandy says, though"
2845080,2845570,Jacob,Tease!
2845810,2846750,Julia,Tandy?
2848950,2852360,Julia,"Cloak is fun, but... Whoa, I need to look at that painting"
2855240,2856930,Julia,"Well, that seems a little on the right"
2856640,2858670,Jacob,"Pride before the fall, huh?"
2858520,2859880,Julia,Just seems a little
2860790,2862280,Julia,Seems a little on the
2862280,2869230,Jacob,And did you notice that Leonard E. Niavos is an anagram for James Sunderland?
2869740,2874330,Jacob,if you rearrange all the letters and change some of them to different letters
2874330,2881300,Julia,Did you notice that stalwart to the end is actually James Sunderland if you rearrange all of the letters?
2881520,2885720,Jacob,And then change some of the letters. -I did notice that actually
2882760,2884440,Julia,And then change some of the letters
2886260,2887980,Jacob,It's pretty crazy
2891300,2893550,Julia,Did you notice that if you change
2893630,2897460,Jacob,"Bottom Hat said,  it does make me laugh every time I hear Luna Snow say I suck"
2897460,2898410,Julia,I suck
2898310,2905850,Jacob,"That is what we hear every time too  and we laugh at it. -I think she's saying like iced up or ice up, but it sounds like she's screaming"
2903170,2903880,Julia,Yeah
2905850,2907420,Julia,I suck
2909650,2910950,Jacob,It cracks me up
2910950,2912840,Julia,We need to talk about this painting
2913530,2915910,Jacob,"AI generated, I can tell"
2916750,2919980,Julia,I just... the eagle just hanging out there
2920850,2925710,Julia,"Truly, America has like ruined American Bald Eagles for me because every time they're in there, I'm like,"
2927210,2931230,Julia,"America, America"
2931570,2935300,Jacob,"Because it is your turn, yeah"
2937370,2940750,Julia,"Oh, man, Jacob and I were listening to"
2942600,2945390,Julia,"Oh my god, is her name Samara? Samara Joy?"
2946570,2947190,Julia,Is that her name?
2947190,2948140,Jacob,Yeah
2951230,2952850,Julia,What? Oh
2954280,2959130,Julia,"So we were listening to her album, her like"
2960930,2962250,Jacob,She's a jazz singer
2962180,2964560,Julia,"She's a jazz singer, great"
2965540,2971360,Julia,"What was I talking about? I got distracted by it because I thought I was just going to twist the little middle thing and then it was like, which book do you want to use?"
2971980,2973200,Julia,"anyway, she's great"
2975140,2976070,Julia,Um
2976070,2978400,Jacob,You had something you were connecting to
2979000,2979980,Julia,What was I connecting it to?
2979980,2983420,Jacob,We were singing America the Beautiful in like a Creed voice
2989420,2991240,Julia,"I lost it, I lost it"
2991370,2995220,Jacob,"Instead, you just said that a singer was really good, which is also acceptable"
2995220,2996840,Julia,"I mean, she's great"
3001720,3002580,Julia,Okay
3004450,3005650,Jacob,I feel like you need a fourth buck
3005650,3018050,Julia,"Oh, that's what it was. So I went on a really quick brain tangent. So the way that Jacob sung the end of that song where basically none of the words were intelligible reminded me of that"
3019150,3022290,Julia,"Christmas song about that one woman song where it was like,"
3022900,3024580,Julia,Quizmoys
3026190,3027180,Jacob,Yes
3027180,3030890,Julia,"Like quiz-moss or whatever she says, is that Christmas?"
3029160,3033690,Jacob,"Or whatever she said,  it said Christmas. We need more info though. Which song was it?"
3034860,3036240,Jacob,Cause I'm trying to remember
3036240,3047360,Julia,"I literally only have the Kelly Clarkson Christmas song stuck in my head, which is not it. -Quizmice, thank you. Camilla Cabello, sorry. Quizmoice"
3047750,3061830,Jacob,"Yes, yes, okay, thank you for knowing because I also couldn't fully get there either. I was like, I know what you're talking about, and I want to provide the proper context, but I can't get it. I'll be home for Christmas, thank you. Oh my God"
3048120,3048970,Julia,Thank you
3049860,3052170,Julia,"Good lord, thank you for catching it"
3060480,3061070,Julia,Yes
3061760,3063730,Julia,I'll be home for
3063550,3065520,Jacob,Wiz-mice
3066690,3074330,Julia,"Um, and if you listen to Samara Joy's Christmas album, it's so freaking good"
3075460,3079430,Julia,"And in the middle of it, I was like,  do you think she thought about saying Quizmoize?"
3079430,3080810,Jacob,Where's Moise?
3080810,3084050,Julia,"All right, I don't know which book goes where, I also don't have all the books"
3084050,3085400,Jacob,"No, you're missing a book"
3085400,3086060,Julia,Oh
3090970,3099660,Jacob,"I like how you were like,  Jacob, let's get through the game quickly. And then you're like, let me stop and stare at a bookshelf for five full minutes while I try to remember Camila Cabello"
3101720,3107840,Julia,"Doesn't work today Jacob, I'm struggling. Mine doesn't either. That's why I need you to lock in so that one of us can be locked in!"
3110140,3111490,Julia,One of us has to be locked in!
3111490,3114150,Jacob,"I can't be locked in, I'm stupid today!"
3116080,3119550,Julia,We have to both lock in so we get like half a brain
3119550,3120480,Jacob,It's locked out
3121090,3122930,Julia,of our own minds
3124040,3128890,Julia,"Pride Before the Fall, that's Alliance, that's top left, and then Eagle"
3130070,3131980,Julia,"Oh, freaking pride"
3132260,3133140,Jacob,Quizmo
3133140,3134890,Julia,Quizmoiz
3136820,3137810,Julia,Um
3138490,3141850,Julia,"The one who's sword, that's the freaking eagle"
3143690,3145440,Julia,That's a eagle
3147130,3148210,Julia,Is that an eagle?
3148970,3149390,Julia,Whatever
3150030,3151360,Julia,That's a ongle
3152440,3153760,Jacob,And that's a devil
3156410,3158030,Jacob,Now hit the thing in the middle
3159550,3160490,Jacob,You can't
3160510,3161070,Julia,I
3161070,3162200,Jacob,You did it wrong
3162200,3163850,Julia,How did I do it wrong?
3163850,3164850,Jacob,You did it wrong
3164850,3165960,Julia,Lion?
3166620,3167410,Julia,Bull?
3168020,3170110,Jacob,"Eagle, angel"
3169320,3171010,Julia,Eagle angle
3171870,3173470,Julia,Does it have to be
3177590,3180510,Julia,flipped to mirror the thing?
3182260,3183610,Julia,Is this not... wait
3192490,3197000,Julia,"Wait, okay, hold on, the spears, the spears mean something. Oh, we got to go upside down"
3197000,3199050,Jacob,The spears are upside down
3200300,3202780,Jacob,",Lion, eagle, no"
3203390,3204220,Jacob,Yes
3204220,3205480,Julia,"Yeah, yeah"
3205920,3210310,Jacob,"And backwards, upside down and backwards"
3206360,3211910,Julia,"Wait, and backwards, and backwards, and backwards. -We got there, ladies and gents"
3213720,3215100,Julia,Yikes!
3215660,3218120,Julia,"All right, I'm locking in, I'm locking in, Jacob"
3219190,3220960,Jacob,She's so locked
3222000,3223370,Julia,"Oh, a six spot"
3222780,3224550,Jacob,She's locked and stocked
3225400,3227610,Jacob,And she got two smoking barrels
3228630,3230170,Jacob,I've never seen that movie
3230490,3236280,Julia,"neither have I, but I imagine that that's what it's about. It's about a few people trying to focus on a video game together"
3236280,3237340,Jacob,I think so
3237340,3238030,Julia,Yeah
3242660,3246730,Jacob,"The gray adder said,  OMG, it's actually James, I wish I was a fan"
3249540,3251990,Jacob,That would be such a fucked up thing to say to someone
3251990,3252670,Julia,Help
3253290,3254440,Julia,"Oh, is it Mary?"
3254340,3255110,Jacob,Miffy
3256110,3257950,Jacob,"Milp, milp"
3260020,3261850,Jacob,"Mouth, Mouth"
3263230,3264240,Jacob,Mewi
3269980,3271410,Julia,It wasn't help Mary

3277880,3278970,Julia,"Okay, hold on"
3284070,3286550,Jacob,"Oh, it's going to be  Milk Mary, Milk Mary"
3285660,3294080,Julia,"No, it can't be, Jacob. -It can't be, it can't, we can't. -We can't, we can't!"
3287730,3289350,Jacob,It's got to be a milk Mary
3295320,3296170,Julia,Can't!
3297590,3298850,Julia,Oh my God!
3308960,3311690,Julia,"Oh, there's a lot of blood under that door"
3316110,3321780,Jacob,"Next to your list stream, we're doing a Milk Mary kill"
3322920,3324350,Jacob,What'd you do to the light bulb?
3324720,3325770,Julia,You know
3326460,3327320,Julia,Stuff happened
3327240,3328890,Jacob,How you get blood on the light bulb?
3328380,3329720,Julia,But apple didn't work
3330900,3335620,Julia,"I don't know, someone probably got pushed into it. -Didn't you ever see that clip from Whose Line is it Anyway?"
3336570,3340350,Julia,Where Ryan Stiles smashed his head into a light bulb
3341530,3343200,Jacob,but like for fake
3343200,3345710,Julia,"No, no, he did it by accident"
3347440,3348550,Jacob,Was he okay?
3348550,3351270,Julia,"He was okay, he just had a lot of glass in his head"
3351270,3352360,Jacob,Oh no
3352900,3361050,Julia,"It was very funny, he was someone who keeps getting magnetized to things and he like went to go get stuck to Drew Carey's desk"
3362050,3363130,Julia,And
3366280,3369580,Julia,And he headbutted the lights that were on his desk and
3372710,3373200,Julia,Hello?
3376830,3378010,Julia,We have
3379990,3381490,Julia,"Okay, the only one we have is"
3382010,3383380,Julia,Hello? Oh
3385790,3390770,Jacob,"He had a lot of glass in him, it was very funny, Julia LePetit 2024"
3392150,3394770,Julia,"My brother, when we were kids,"
3395430,3398360,Julia,"or when I was a kid, he was like in high school or something"
3398460,3399870,Jacob,That's also a kid
3399870,3400680,Julia,"Yeah, yeah"
3400680,3401600,Jacob,If you think about it
3401570,3404740,Julia,"Yeah, he was in the"
3410940,3412340,Julia,Why is there like a frog?
3414750,3415540,Julia,Um
3419190,3420690,Jacob,Do you
3428280,3433920,Julia,"Anyway, he got into a car accident where he went through the windshield"
3434660,3439830,Julia,"because he wasn't wearing a seatbelt, and then we had to go to"
3440600,3445280,Julia,"uh, like a mass, basically, it was like for my confirmation or whatever"
3446270,3458670,Julia,"And during the mass, I was picking glass out of his head and we like, my mom asked us how it went and we were like, oh, it's pretty fun. -I just picked glass out of Mike's head for the entire thing and she was like, what?"
3459200,3463210,Jacob,"Wait, what? How much time was in between these two things happening?"
3463210,3469800,Julia,"Oh, like a day. He was in the hospital for like a few days or something"
3469800,3471970,Jacob,They didn't take the glass out of his head in the hospital?
3471970,3473460,Julia,He had some leftover
3474180,3477090,Julia,"It was really stuck in there, he went through the windshield of his tree"
3477090,3478740,Jacob,I remember that story
3478710,3479360,Julia,Yeah
3480830,3482450,Julia,"Anyway, wear your seatbelt, everyone"
3484750,3486450,Julia,They were just going like down the block
3491230,3495480,Jacob,Do you have any more horrifying stories you want to tell about people getting glass embedded in their heads?
3495480,3496800,Julia,"No, that's all of it"
3500440,3501610,Jacob,Nice dodge
3501610,3502920,Julia,Thank you
3503970,3504780,Julia,Um
3505280,3511630,Julia,"My brother and all of his friends, by the way, were sober. His friend just like unfortunately hit a curve"
3512860,3513720,Julia,A curb
3514360,3515290,Julia,And
3516560,3521010,Julia,the car did not behave itself
3528660,3529250,Julia,Okay
3530430,3531780,Julia,"Okay, we came back around"
3534260,3536440,Jacob,When I come around
3536790,3537940,Julia,What the hell was that?
3538430,3540470,Jacob,That was me saying when I come around
3548200,3549950,Jacob,There's some thunking and muttering
3552420,3554690,Julia,and like someone was saying something
3554780,3556840,Jacob,"Yeah, that was the muttering I was referring to"
3560770,3561870,Julia,Because I think that's
3563230,3564510,Julia,"No, it's two"
3565800,3566390,Julia,That's a
3567540,3568180,Julia,Okay
3574020,3574670,Julia,I knew it!
3577510,3578030,Julia,Jerk
3578910,3580230,Julia,I got you
3581460,3585740,Jacob,"You know they thought they had you too. -They were like, I'm going to get his ass"
3583260,3583890,Julia,Yeah
3585090,3586110,Julia,Do I? Ha ha!
3592110,3593220,Julia,That kind of sucks
3595620,3597080,Jacob,It's probably a cheaper room
3598420,3600730,Julia,"Well, I mean like the wallpaper's fallen"
3601080,3602320,Jacob,It's probably a cheaper room
3602320,3603510,Julia,"Oh yeah, you're right"
3605720,3613520,Jacob,"If I ran a hotel, I would keep like a couple rooms that were like intentionally like incredibly shitty that I could give to people for really cheap"
3614360,3616630,Jacob,But I would make them like shittier on purpose
3617990,3620560,Julia,They'd be in fine condition when you got to them
3620560,3621450,Jacob,Yeah
3623120,3625330,Julia,"I think that's what poor people deserve, really"
3625640,3627270,Jacob,That's what I'm kind of getting at here
3627270,3630020,Julia,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I think you're right"
3633160,3633800,Julia,No
3634770,3636760,Julia,"I saw you, okay"
3637820,3639910,Julia,I want to call you out
3641330,3642630,Julia,"Oh, we've been in this room"
3652260,3653900,Julia,"Yeah, we've been here, this is the Swan room"
3654750,3659030,Jacob,"I'm trying to remember what my friend Kevin said when we were in Georgia where he was like,"
3660720,3662730,Julia,All you need is a good nest egg
3661510,3666610,Jacob,"He was like, why is anyone poor? All you need is a good nest egg and substantial cash flow"
3666610,3670880,Julia,"Yeah, that is what he said. That's exactly what he said"
3671890,3677830,Jacob,"He was like, it's so easy, it's two steps. -Just have a good nest egg and then a substantial cash flow"
3678030,3679050,Julia,Yeah
3680160,3681970,Julia,it cracked me up
3682610,3691010,Jacob,He was not serious in case that was unclear. -But he delivers everything like he is serious
3684630,3685220,Julia,No
3686610,3688920,Julia,But his delivery every time
3691010,3692950,Julia,It's so dry
3692880,3693610,Jacob,Yeah
3695600,3697340,Julia,Why are we so choppy?
3698440,3699480,Julia,What's up with this room?
3700490,3702030,Julia,We gotta get out of the shopping room
3705000,3706160,Julia,is happening
3706160,3708320,Jacob,"Oh, that's what I was doing wrong"
3710820,3712220,Jacob,"Yeah, if you don't have"
3713400,3721740,Jacob,"a big enough nest egg, just save more money until it's big enough. -And if you don't have enough cash flow, then just make more money"
3723190,3725030,Jacob,so that more cash is coming in
3725330,3726060,Julia,Yeah
3725890,3729690,Jacob,And then you'll have both of the things in the two-step process
3734510,3735750,Julia,They forgot the bed
3737790,3739190,Julia,They forgot the bed in this one
3741080,3743680,Jacob,"Everyone in chat is like,  I feel so stupid right now"
3743680,3744930,Julia,"Yeah, you should"
3745080,3746460,Jacob,"Yeah, like why didn't you do it?"
3746460,3749280,Julia,Why is it so simple? Why didn't you just do that?
3749280,3753670,Jacob,"What the hell is a nest egg? -'See, this is why you're struggling"
3753670,3755440,Julia,"If you don't know what a nest egg is,"
3756030,3757500,Julia,"Sorry, you just don't have it"
3767640,3769700,Julia,Kevin is genuinely so funny
3770290,3772380,Julia,He sounds so serious
3774840,3777380,Jacob,Kevin is one of my best friends since like
3778370,3779600,Jacob,elementary school
3780330,3781610,Julia,"He, um"
3784800,3785480,Julia,Can we help you?
3786170,3814400,Julia,"Come here, Miss Odin! At the wedding that we were in, or that we went to, Kevin was in it, and he kept rummaging in his pocket and locking eyes with me and going, you want some? You want some of this? You want this? You want some? You want to partake? You want some? You want this? Like that rapidly, and I was like, what are you talking about? And then he finally got it out of his jacket after like two minutes of trying to get this thing out of his blazer. It was a freaking wedding ring,"
3817320,3820380,Jacob,"And then he just kept saying,  you want some of this?"
3818640,3819780,Julia,You want some?
3821010,3822200,Jacob,You want some of this?
3828050,3831500,Julia,"And then you just kept saying, yeah, take it"
3834900,3837700,Julia,"And then Jacob's other friend, who I'd only met once"
3839390,3840170,Julia,Um
3845420,3846970,Julia,We said hi to him
3847800,3852980,Julia,"We're like, oh, hey, haven't seen you in a while. He's like, oh yeah, I'm a yo-yo"
3853850,3857430,Julia,"He's just starting yo-yoing. -He's like, uh, kind of sucks"
3857430,3858680,Jacob,"Yeah, my friend Key"
3860060,3861870,Julia,"I was like, what is happening?"
3863050,3863660,Julia,Okay
3866160,3872820,Jacob,"I'm pretty sure I was like, I saw him, he was dressed really nicely. -I was like, I was like, damn dude, you look really good. -And he was like, oh, thanks, I got a yo-yo"
3873040,3875230,Julia,"Yeah, yeah, he did do that"
3875230,3878220,Jacob,And just pulled a yo-yo out of his jacket and started yo-yoing
3880400,3885980,Julia,Good times. -That was a really baffling series of events at this wedding for me
3886690,3888580,Jacob,Do I have normal friends? No
3888580,3889490,Julia,Uh-uh
3890930,3895790,Jacob,"But all the ones I do have are ride or die, lifelong"
3898460,3902710,Julia,I would say you have one group that is very normal
3903840,3905540,Jacob,Which group? College Friends?
3905490,3906230,Julia,Yeah
3907130,3909050,Jacob,College friends are probably the most normal
3909050,3910050,Julia,Yeah
3913790,3920170,Jacob,"Now I get why Jacob is funny, he was raised in the funny. -It's literally one of those things that I think all the time is that,"
3921050,3924120,Jacob,I feel like all of my friends are funnier than I am
3924950,3926740,Jacob,And so I'm oftentimes
3927280,3932100,Jacob,confused and baffled by the fact that I've managed to make a career out of
3932810,3934330,Jacob,it to some degree
3935010,3938790,Jacob,"Because in my mind, I'm like, but I'm not as funny as like any of my friends"
3938970,3940050,Julia,Right
3940050,3940840,Jacob,I'm like
3941870,3945960,Jacob,"any of them should be more successful than me, but none of them tried to do it, so"
3946460,3947580,Julia,But I do think
3946630,3948220,Jacob,That's their mistake
3948220,3953910,Julia,"I do think that being a funny person and making that a transferable skill,"
3954950,3957800,Julia,"like an accessible skill, like your friends are funny"
3958670,3960470,Jacob,but I got better social skills
3961500,3963810,Julia,"Yeah, like, like Kevin"
3962950,3965480,Jacob,"I'm well balanced, I'm like Mario"
3965480,3972030,Julia,"Kevin cracks me up, but it's truly only because we've played video games with him enough"
3972640,3977210,Julia,that I've gotten used to the things that he says being jokes
3977750,3980010,Julia,"because half of the time I'm like,"
3980890,3982900,Julia,I don't know if you're serious or not
3982900,3987080,Jacob,"Yeah, I guess that is true. Most people, when they meet him, do not know what to make of him"
3987370,3989900,Julia,I am often very confused
3994690,4003380,Jacob,"Do you have a comedy nest egg and substantial funny flow? I do, yeah, my funny flow is off the charts. I'm getting all the funny from my friends"
4004160,4008510,Jacob,That's where the funny flow comes in  and then I save it in my comedy nest egg
4011890,4013260,Julia,So how do we get up?
4015870,4021410,Jacob,But there's something about people who I think are like the funniest people and it's that they're not just like
4022110,4029390,Jacob,",people who are being funny, it's that the funny is like a part of them. -It is like how they live their life"
4026960,4027570,Julia,Yeah
4030110,4032980,Jacob,something in like their very nature is funny
4033290,4034050,Julia,Yeah
4033890,4041120,Jacob,"And there's like, you can't manufacture that kind of funny. -You either are that person or you're not that person"
4041420,4041760,Julia,Hmm
4043170,4044530,Jacob,I have to like think
4045740,4046960,Jacob,a lot about it
4047240,4048200,Julia,Right
4048200,4054430,Jacob,"And then, you know, be funny. -They're just like, they just are funny. -I think that's the difference"
4055430,4056350,Julia,Right
4059050,4061110,Jacob,That's how I am with dourness
4062920,4064720,Jacob,born into the dourness
4067040,4071630,Julia,"like I find you... we have a friend, the other friend that we play"
4072670,4074060,Julia,Marvel with
4074730,4077630,Julia,",uh, along with Kevin"
4079020,4082110,Julia,"who I also think is very funny, but he's like"
4083760,4085970,Julia,a really inaccessible funny
4086510,4088150,Jacob,He's like an insult comic
4088150,4092450,Julia,"He is like an insult comic, like it cracks me up and you just have to be like ready for it"
4093600,4095400,Julia,So... okay
4095990,4102910,Julia,"They said the thing was in the safe in the employee area, so it's not here, right?"
4106140,4108180,Julia,I didn't unlock this while I was here earlier
4108800,4110420,Julia,I wasn't locked in yet
4111160,4112600,Julia,but I'm locked in now
4115870,4116410,Julia,Um
4118150,4124970,Julia,"Like, I would say that his comedy only works with a very particular group of people"
4125810,4126300,Jacob,Yeah
4125850,4127840,Julia,But I do find him very funny
4128070,4130860,Jacob,"I mean, I do too, that's why we've been friends for so long"
4130860,4131840,Julia,Yeah
4136430,4140530,Julia,"We did that. The vanity mirror, we don't have the light bulb for"
4142380,4149300,Julia,"202 we don't have the key for. I probably missed something in one of these rooms, huh?"
4154260,4155560,Julia,You know what? Is it
4158060,4161670,Julia,was I supposed to know the lock combo?
4162430,4163590,Jacob,Milk Mary
4163860,4164860,Julia,Yeah
4168220,4170290,Julia,Was I supposed to know that?
4172760,4174900,Jacob,"Not yet, people are saying"
4174900,4175980,Julia,Okay
4177530,4179350,Jacob,breakable wall on the second floor
4179360,4181140,Julia,"Second floor, okay, thank you"
4183170,4184490,Jacob,Gift shop maybe?
4186390,4189110,Julia,"Like I said, my brain just engaged"
4189080,4192370,Jacob,You can jump the counter in the cloak room on the second floor
4193480,4198950,Julia,"That explains the white, I was wondering about that, and for some reason I just didn't try it, but thank you"
4210740,4212180,Jacob,Wow
4215430,4217650,Jacob,What is happening in this room?
4218440,4219320,Julia,I quit
4221360,4222890,Julia,Why would you do that?
4223310,4226170,Jacob,How could this happen to me?
4227520,4231250,Jacob,That's... I don't like any of this. Look at the legs
4231480,4233090,Julia,The legs are really cracking me up
4234200,4235990,Jacob,That's like your drunk Aunt Linda
4236710,4238520,Jacob,who stumbled over the couch
4239730,4240700,Julia,"Oh, 202"
4240700,4244040,Jacob,That was a totally random name and I realize now you do have an album
4244000,4246270,Julia,I do have an Aunt Linda who does not drink
4246270,4249960,Jacob,"No, but I think in general, if you took a survey,"
4251410,4253980,Jacob,of all the Aunt Lindas in America
4256310,4260740,Jacob,I think more than 50% of them would be the type to drink too much and fall over the couch
4260740,4261740,Julia,That's fair
4261740,4263340,Jacob,That's what I would guess
4263340,4264020,Julia,Okay
4279560,4280860,Jacob,An un-rotten apple
4280860,4281840,Julia,A ripe epazote
4281640,4282800,Jacob,Ripe apple
4282800,4283750,Julia,Who put that there?
4283750,4284840,Jacob,"Right back, boo"
4284840,4286070,Julia,I'll be right back
4287390,4288320,Julia,"Hello, sir"
4290210,4291690,Julia,Looks like my friend Kyle
4294260,4294920,Julia,Weird
4303620,4304990,Jacob,Bullets on the balcony
4307820,4309110,Julia,We love to see it
4327740,4328750,Julia,Take no prisoners
4333710,4336130,Julia,"I heard the noises she was making and I went,  mm-mm"
4336130,4337270,Jacob,We're not doing it
4337310,4338280,Julia,Not doing it
4341030,4343680,Jacob,"MSS, Mary Sunderland"
4344650,4345930,Julia,Stacy Sunderland
4345930,4348020,Jacob,Mary Stacy Sunderland
4350940,4351970,Jacob,"Oh, you can't open it?"
4351900,4354550,Julia,"I can't open it, apparently. James is not interested"
4355530,4359870,Julia,"James wants nothing to do with it. -Is there anything in there? Nope, is there anything in here?"
4362970,4366840,Julia,"Nope, all right, I just broke this for nothing, that's fine, it was satisfying"
4368420,4371860,Julia,What about these? Anything? No? What about this?
4373910,4374570,Julia,Anything?
4375160,4376570,Julia,"No, okay"
4377170,4378570,Julia,Someone
4380810,4387170,Julia,"Someone in one of the YouTube VODs, like, time stamped one of the nurses and it says,"
4387810,4394530,Julia,"And they wrote like, why did she make that noise? Oh my God, was that a mistake?"
4402970,4404570,Julia,Are we missing the point?
4404820,4406380,Jacob,I think we know why
4405890,4407460,Julia,Are we missing the point of these?
4407030,4409110,Jacob,I think we know why she made the noise
4409110,4410690,Julia,of these non-literal ladies?
4410490,4412670,Jacob,Like a Dark Souls character taking a hit
4413680,4414100,Julia,Yeah
4414100,4415280,Jacob,Not of weed
4415740,4417330,Julia,"Well, they could be"
4417680,4418560,Jacob,Maybe
4419170,4422050,Jacob,"If your Dark Souls protag took a big puff and was like,"
4422050,4423170,Julia,Oh
4433190,4434100,Julia,No prisoners
4436110,4437390,Julia,I suffer no fools
4444480,4445320,Julia,Okay
4445980,4452270,Jacob,"What do you think they're burning on those bonfires? -So true, I think they're sitting at the bonfire so much"
4456930,4458100,Julia,anything in this cabinet?
4459460,4459850,Julia,Buh
4459850,4460980,Jacob,Bottles
4462520,4465490,Jacob,"Take a jizzle of the scoobert, Ashen1"
4471330,4474700,Jacob,Don't remind me of shit I said
4476960,4481840,Julia,"Smell of Vader, smell of Vader, taste"
4487760,4488510,Julia,Okay
4490680,4493000,Julia,Just going to check all these rooms
4498210,4498580,Jacob,Oh!
4501300,4503630,Julia,"You can't go back to your hiding spot, all right?"
4502920,4504690,Jacob,"No, we know"
4504690,4507460,Julia,"But blow it, you can't reset, okay? I'm sorry"
4508220,4510140,Julia,You get one hit for a good measure
4510260,4511200,Jacob,One hit
4520470,4521700,Jacob,We see you
4525390,4526830,Jacob,"Damn, you never stood a chance"
4526830,4529020,Julia,"No, well, she stood"
4530240,4531200,Julia,but not a chance
4531130,4532380,Jacob,Not a chance
4536060,4541780,Julia,I came to this hotel with my porcelain and my box and the porcelain didn't survive
4541780,4547530,Jacob,All that was in the suitcase was one loose porcelain doll and a wooden box
4550080,4551420,Jacob,"Damn, damn, damn"
4551960,4553170,Jacob,It's a great shame
4554570,4555260,Julia,Great shape
4557640,4559790,Julia,"Okay, you didn't get to find anything in one of those?"
4564140,4565130,Julia,Oh
4572290,4576630,Julia,I do want to say I appreciate the
4581720,4582250,Julia,Don't
4583330,4602670,Julia,"I appreciate the level of backseating that's been happening during this Silent Hill game, and I don't know if it's chat being real good with their backseating, which I appreciate, or if it's the mods, but I feel like everyone's letting me make mistakes, and then when I'm genuinely confused, someone throws me a little hint"
4602890,4604690,Jacob,"Chat's been good, they've been good for this game"
4604320,4605010,Julia,They were great
4610720,4612340,Jacob,"Very proud of you, Chad"
4613680,4619540,Jacob,"Chat, you've made me proud, puts my hand on your shoulder in a fatherly gesture since I'm going to be a father now"
4619860,4620940,Julia,That's true
4621210,4623660,Jacob,I'm going to be saying so much dadly shit to y'all
4623660,4624500,Julia,Mm-hmm
4625010,4627000,Jacob,I'm gonna be like doling out advice
4629130,4636840,Julia,"I am, but yeah, it's been really nice because my goal with Secret Sleepover,"
4638000,4643030,Julia,is to enjoy the game how it's meant to be enjoyed. Shall I use a rotten apple? No
4643650,4655530,Julia,"the Puss in the Doll though, but also, you know, not to get too bogged down. So when people like jump on me to play the game optimally, I'm like, okay, let's chill. But"
4657070,4659620,Julia,"Since it's taking you this long to get to the conference room,"
4660530,4664580,Julia,"You might as well drop by room 107, I'm leaving you the key, one of the guests made quite a mess"
4664800,4668240,Jacob,"Ooh, a little Messi Milton in 107"
4668950,4671140,Julia,I'll take that one kill
4673610,4675720,Jacob,A bit of a messy Melissa
4675990,4677640,Julia,Eww
4678180,4683010,Julia,"I found the problem, Silent Hill, it's black mold everywhere"
4683780,4685390,Jacob,That's like always the answer
4685350,4686590,Julia,It's always the answer
4687010,4692440,Jacob,"If you have any problem in your life, you should really check your living space for black mold"
4693500,4695010,Jacob,Roll that one out first
4695010,4699320,Julia,"Yeah, get one of those mold sniffing dogs in your house"
4699930,4706720,Julia,Jacob and I were watching something and there was this girl with like a metric ton of problems and she was like seven
4707150,4711000,Jacob,like a ton of health issues and depression and
4708440,4709990,Julia,A ton of health issues
4711000,4723420,Julia,"anxiety and panic attacks and couldn't go out anywhere and just like issue after issue after issue and they were like, suddenly it just hit like out of nowhere and then they looked at a room and it was just like full of black mold"
4723420,4724860,Jacob,"Yeah, the walls were like"
4724860,4726760,Julia,peeling off with black more like
4725650,4728640,Jacob,The walls are like more black mold than wall
4730460,4731200,Jacob,Mary?
4738270,4738830,Julia,Hello?
4740310,4741500,Julia,May we?
4743250,4747390,Julia,"Dodge, Julia, dodge. You can't stun him, there's no stunning in this game"
4748330,4751370,Jacob,They're always going to hit you if they're in there
4752040,4754020,Jacob,jump scare animation
4754020,4754860,Julia,Yeah
4754760,4758940,Jacob,"You do have approximately 50 healing items, that's not an exaggeration"
4759890,4760890,Julia,"Yeah, it's true"
4765100,4767960,Julia,"May we? Well, she's in 312 or whatever, right?"
4769730,4771450,Jacob,"Yeah, we got to go to 107"
4772070,4775010,Jacob,",107.5, the room"
4779470,4781590,Julia,"Well, we have the key to 312"
4784540,4786230,Jacob,We have the key to 107
4786230,4789830,Julia,That's true. Should we go to 107 first or should we just try 312?
4789830,4791110,Jacob,"Do whatever you want, man"
4794600,4796360,Jacob,See if I care
4797760,4798990,Jacob,That's 318
4800200,4802250,Julia,"Yeah, I was just trying them since we're over here anyway"
4806130,4808080,Julia,"Who's that? Oh, it's Joy Cat"
4807600,4811100,Jacob,"It's Joy Cat, it's Joy Cat"
4811830,4814060,Jacob,She is a beautiful cat
4816390,4818020,Julia,She is a beautiful cat
4817110,4820990,Jacob,"Joy, the laugh is, oh, she gave you a headbutt"
4820990,4823050,Julia,Really strong one
4823780,4826010,Jacob,Make a space for her immediately
4826010,4826930,Julia,Come here
4828250,4830970,Jacob,"There she is, there she is"
4830900,4832330,Julia,Hi
4833040,4836920,Julia,We've been giving... so the cats have
4837550,4845530,Julia,"a massive lump on their throat, which is very worrying, but we're trying some antibiotics first"
4846170,4849900,Julia,and some like anti-inflammatory stuff and whatever
4851030,4856380,Julia,"because it's in like a tricky spot, so we don't want to like, you know, do a biopsy, we're trying to see if it goes away"
4856990,4862140,Julia,"Since giving her the medicine, hello, she's back to her old self"
4862710,4864820,Julia,of being kind of an asshole
4864990,4868140,Jacob,"Yeah, so I think we may have found an issue"
4868260,4870560,Julia,"Yeah, she's like a little bit of a rascal"
4870560,4884360,Jacob,"But yes, both cats, we were at the vet and the vet was like, we told the vet that Joy had a lump on her neck and he was like, oh, that's really concerning. -He was like, I'm not sure what it is, we'll try this, we'll try this. -And then we're like, also Olive has a lump on her neck in the same spot"
4884970,4885660,Jacob,What?
4886370,4886710,Julia,Hey
4886390,4888710,Jacob,"And then he felt and he was like, what the?"
4889290,4891820,Jacob,"That's really confusing, why would they"
4891820,4892690,Julia,Yeah
4892700,4893640,Jacob,Both?
4893880,4896680,Julia,Our vet is also like extremely good
4897940,4898370,Julia,Uh
4898330,4901100,Jacob,He looks so puzzled for the rest of the visit
4901100,4902720,Julia,"He was like, it's really bothering me"
4902640,4904910,Jacob,He would pause and just be thinking
4904910,4905820,Julia,Yeah
4906960,4911950,Julia,"We really, really, really like our vet. He was a... he worked at like"
4912810,4916270,Julia,"you know, cat rescues for the longest time"
4917370,4922820,Julia,"Um, so he knows his stuff, so when he says something's puzzling, I'm like, uh-oh"
4924020,4924860,Julia,That ain't good
4925810,4927850,Julia,I do feel like their throat's getting better though
4925840,4926350,Jacob,But I
4927850,4929740,Jacob,"Yeah, I mean, they've both been acting"
4930330,4935420,Jacob,"better, I do think it might be a... they both got like really bad colds"
4935560,4936330,Julia,Yeah
4936280,4940100,Jacob,and were like sick for a while and then after that this happened
4941110,4946380,Jacob,And so I don't know if it was like some sort of little like infection from being sick and coughing
4947290,4950310,Jacob,or like an irritation in the lymph nodes or
4951270,4952310,Julia,Yeah
4953130,4957950,Julia,"Someone said maybe it's a lymph node, so the lump is not like"
4959600,4961440,Jacob,It's like a little too low
4961440,4973390,Julia,"Yeah, it's too low on the neck to be a lymph node, but we thought the same thing, and then when we told our vet, he thought the same thing, and then he felt it, and he was like, it's not a lymph node. He's like, I also don't like how it feels"
4974760,4975450,Julia,So
4986300,4989040,Jacob,"But Joy does, like we said, seem to be"
4990130,4993100,Jacob,"feeling a lot better since we started giving him the medicine, so"
4993680,4995780,Julia,"Absolutely, she's"
4996410,5003310,Julia,"When I say she's like kind of an asshole, she's still the sweetest cat, but she is getting into trouble"
5004120,5007010,Julia,She's trying to steal fish from Jacob
5004360,5004760,Jacob,Yeah
5007010,5012320,Jacob,"She's jumping in the cabinets.  When I open a cabinet, she leaps in it. -She's going places she's not supposed to"
5012320,5014150,Julia,"Mm-hmm, she's a rascal"
5015360,5017060,Julia,"Not just half, and while you're at it,"
5017760,5023900,Julia,"Be sure to sweep up the leaves out in the garden, then you can get back to the fireplace, all right, jerk?"
5032020,5034920,Julia,What? What? What? What?
5033810,5035810,Jacob,What? What?
5035760,5037310,Julia,What? Is it the bug?
5042140,5043800,Jacob,"Well, they come"
5046730,5048390,Jacob,Here they come
5049990,5050810,Jacob,Bang!
5053450,5056080,Jacob,"James, that felt like murder"
5056500,5058340,Julia,"It did, I did shoot her in the back"
5058070,5062530,Jacob,That one felt like she was just walking in the garden and you blasted her
5062530,5063960,Julia,"Yeah, she was"
5065180,5066800,Jacob,That's what I'm talking about
5067840,5069460,Jacob,The dodgies
5070310,5071770,Julia,I heard someone else
5074050,5076060,Julia,"Uh-oh, there's dramatic music happening"
5084380,5086440,Julia,"I'm locked in, man, I woke up"
5087450,5090120,Julia,"for the first time today, I finally woke up"
5090930,5094710,Jacob,Are they drinking filtered water or tap? -They mostly drink tap water
5095840,5096500,Julia,"Oh, yeah"
5096380,5098570,Jacob,Is there a thing with tap water and cats?
5098570,5100580,Julia,I have six lives
5103550,5105440,Julia,So something with everything
5111630,5113080,Julia,We change it every day though
5115600,5118480,Jacob,"The water fresh, it's NYC tap, yeah"
5118480,5119930,Julia,It's a NYC tap
5119730,5122140,Jacob,"NYC tap, best tap water in the world"
5127160,5129220,Jacob,Incredible tap water over here
5130720,5132760,Jacob,"The bagel water, that's right, Draz"
5132760,5134280,Julia,There's that bagel water
5134410,5136420,Jacob,We're giving the cats bagel water
5140520,5142020,Jacob,Pizza grade water
5142020,5143220,Julia,Yeah!
5145520,5148180,Jacob,"Someone mentioned thyroid issues, did they check that?"
5149060,5151640,Jacob,"I don't think they checked that, but I don't know"
5152590,5155460,Jacob,I imagine that the vet will
5152600,5154110,Julia,I'm sure I'm bad when it's out of it
5156370,5157400,Jacob,The vet would know
5157380,5159200,Julia,We have to go back the day after Christmas
5159200,5160100,Jacob,Yeah
5160330,5162040,Julia,"sorry, quiz mice"
5162880,5164370,Jacob,Quez-mais
5166750,5169920,Jacob,And hopefully they'll be doing better by then and we'll have to do nothing more
5170190,5171820,Julia,"Well, one"
5172570,5175400,Julia,"Joy's side, I was just trying to feel for it and I couldn't feel it"
5176310,5177780,Jacob,I think they're getting better
5177780,5178640,Julia,So do I
5196060,5202710,Julia,"Speaking of tap water, and I'm not saying this about the tap water thing, it just like made me think of it"
5203210,5204560,Jacob,Here she goes
5204560,5206300,Julia,I'm about to say the most
5207080,5211530,Julia,"I don't know, boomer thing I'm maybe ever going to say"
5210420,5212610,Jacob,"Here it comes, she's booming"
5213740,5217570,Julia,I think that if you go on
5218620,5221720,Julia,",uh, TikTok or social media"
5220170,5220830,Jacob,Uh oh
5221610,5222920,Jacob,Here it comes
5223070,5226010,Julia,"and you give... again, this is not about the tap water,"
5226920,5228020,Julia,It just reminded me
5228640,5238890,Julia,"You give bad information, health information, like medicine information, -and it's like purposefully misleading or incorrect or harmful, you should be fined"
5238890,5240140,Jacob,Straight to jail
5241640,5245250,Julia,stop selling your goddamn supplements and telling people to
5246460,5248320,Julia,sun their buttholes or whatever
5251980,5253380,Julia,"Ads are about to start, so"
5256180,5262930,Julia,"I'm just so tired of it. I'm tired of like... So again, in my pregnancy, everyone has something to tell me"
5263730,5269990,Julia,"And all my friends who have something to tell me, it's been great. -It's like a village has come together, it's been so"
5271290,5275050,Julia,heartwarming and sweet and like the nicest thing
5275960,5277110,Julia,"Um, but like"
5277830,5285730,Julia,"the advice that they're giving me tells me that they weren't getting this advice, and that they were getting the opposite advice, and I was like"
5287540,5289660,Jacob,Who's giving you this bad advice?
5290310,5292670,Julia,Where are your friends getting their information from?
5293550,5303080,Julia,"And a lot of it is like, oh, I saw a TikTok and then I just said it like it was a fact to other people and then they go around saying it's a fact and it's like,"
5303690,5304280,Julia,No
5305610,5309730,Julia,Stop drinking like liquid metal or whatever. What are you doing?
5315400,5316920,Julia,I'm just like so tired of it
5317660,5326400,Jacob,"I'm going to go on TikTok, I'm going to start a series where I just like come on the screen and I'm like, don't let your baby look at the color purple"
5327070,5329220,Jacob,It will make them
5330370,5331560,Jacob,Um
5332390,5334330,Jacob,Eating disorder
5335830,5339290,Julia,You just literally pulled things out of a hat. Don't let your baby
5339830,5341790,Julia,Look at the color purple
5341790,5344290,Jacob,"But if you buy my peanuts,"
5345690,5345970,Julia,What's this?
5345970,5350140,Jacob,"It fix it, it fix it. Buy my peanuts, it fix it"
5348510,5349000,Julia,Yeah
5350140,5359090,Julia,"So there's two things there. One, did you see the woman on TikTok who said that the reason that people have glasses is because they're using glasses?"
5360320,5362930,Jacob,"Yeah, I see that's a classic one"
5362700,5363660,Julia,It's great
5363580,5365870,Jacob,That glasses are making your vision worse
5365870,5376890,Julia,"Yeah, and that actually not wearing your glasses anymore will make your eyes stronger, so it's actually like a big con by glasses"
5377990,5379150,Julia,Companies
5378780,5383540,Jacob,"Yeah, you got to train your eyes back up. -They're getting weaker because you're giving in to them"
5383540,5386760,Julia,"Yeah, it's"
5387860,5394760,Julia,"stupid, but it's like that's that's like exactly the kind of thing that people like say"
5395980,5397290,Julia,and then they'll just do it
5398420,5403790,Julia,"but only if you also sell supplements. My favorite argument is when they're like,"
5404300,5420580,Julia,"don't listen to your doctor, your doctor is bought by big pharma and they're pushing drugs on you and actually they get a commission every time they prescribe you a drug, you should instead use supplements and coincidentally I sell some, link in the description"
5423160,5425350,Julia,Let's not think about that too deeply
5423790,5426500,Jacob,Subscribe to my course
5426930,5427620,Julia,Yeah
5427620,5431530,Jacob,"If you take my course, by the end of it, you'll have 4020 vision"
5432580,5435140,Julia,"Yeah, she was selling that course"
5432830,5436020,Jacob,You'll be seeing it in the damn future
5436020,5438060,Julia,About eye exercises or whatever
5440630,5447930,Julia,"Although, did you see that study that's like, your baby needs to have interactions with colors, it like helps their brain develop?"
5447930,5449320,Jacob,But not purple
5449890,5451480,Jacob,What? Did you not see my TikTok?
5451480,5470090,Julia,"Oh, I'm so sorry, I missed, I must've missed that. But there was that like sad beige mom movement where they were like coloring all their kids toys to not be neon colors anymore because they found it overstimulating and they didn't want to have to look at brightly colored kids toys anymore"
5471100,5476760,Julia,"or it was just like aesthetically pleasing or whatever the excuse was and then doctors were like,"
5478240,5483350,Julia,"Your kid needs that. Like they need colors, this is the reason that they're also brightly colored"
5484200,5490190,Jacob,The Sad Beige Babies. -Something really funny about that to me. -Great band name
5491320,5492480,Julia,"You're so right, dude"
5492480,5494270,Jacob,The sad beige babies
5494590,5496330,Julia,"Santa bitch, baby"
5498260,5498800,Julia,All right
5500470,5503650,Julia,"Anyway, yeah, hi, what's up? What's up, sweetie?"
5504520,5507570,Julia,"Joy, you got all your food"
5507570,5512900,Jacob,"Olive's rising, she's rising, everyone please stand, please rise for Miss Olive"
5514780,5517340,Julia,"Yeah, there's a lot of like bad"
5517950,5524510,Julia,information out there though for moms and a lot of like pressure about stupid things where it's like
5526230,5527940,Julia,"I don't know, I'm so like"
5531230,5538270,Julia,"you know, let's just do our best with what we got at all times. Oh, wait, I got the bulk cutters. That's for outside, right?"
5539330,5555870,Julia,"I'm so just like, let's do the best with the information we got and let's just try to be as informed as we got, you know, all the time, like that's my goal and it's like, sorry, I was doing the best with what I had available and you know, I'll always be ready to fix or correct"
5557760,5558940,Julia,"Oh, it dissolved it"
5560410,5561100,Julia,Um
5561640,5566230,Julia,"If something new presents itself, I'm always open to like changing my mindset about a thing"
5567320,5568170,Julia,Um
5569080,5569480,Julia,)
5573310,5574040,Julia,Um
5577590,5583320,Julia,",Large one in the west, tempted by the Lord's appeal, failed to resist it"
5584130,5585890,Julia,"Oh, damn, it us though"
5588960,5590460,Jacob,"Damn, so true"
5592180,5593110,Julia,"Joy, come here"
5592620,5592960,Jacob,Come here
5594160,5598020,Julia,The lore was how horny we felt
5599390,5601130,Jacob,Everyone please rise

5602100,5604400,Jacob,Joy Cat has arrived on the scene
5606070,5610310,Jacob,"Please salute your new president, Joy"
5610660,5615300,Julia,I would gladly vote for Joy over our impending option
5615300,5617380,Jacob,Olive has abdicated the throne
5619600,5621750,Jacob,And joy has risen to the occasion
5625310,5628580,Julia,"fireplace, okay, we got to, well, we went to 202, right?"
5629850,5633760,Julia,"We did go to 202, right? Well, we have to do the light bulb anyway"
5635480,5637800,Julia,"Uh, my little buddy"
5638930,5640830,Julia,Reading room
5642030,5642760,Julia,"Okay, yeah"
5643840,5644560,Julia,Um
5647140,5648170,Julia,"Anyway, like"
5650740,5657390,Julia,There's so much pressure on moms to like do... to like get the best for their baby or they failed
5658150,5660960,Julia,"which is like pretty classist, really"
5662160,5663040,Julia,Um
5671710,5672590,Jacob,Apple?
5677160,5678700,Jacob,Why did James grunt?
5688540,5694870,Jacob,"You thought the light bulb went in the light bulb slot, you absolute dickhead"
5698120,5698700,Julia,The hell?
5700540,5701780,Julia,"Uh, okay"
5703350,5707980,Julia,"I guess we got to like, we probably got to like paint it red or something"
5708970,5709650,Julia,Um
5710530,5713800,Julia,"Anyway, one of the many things that"
5715060,5717340,Julia,women are pressured about is like breastfeeding
5719080,5724800,Julia,"because it is like better for your baby, I guess, but like they're like, don't use formula. If you use formula, you're up"
5725880,5727150,Julia,failure
5727790,5732600,Julia,And that's like what someone was telling me is like how they were made to feel
5733140,5739110,Julia,"about it, and they had some problems and they couldn't breastfeed and they had to use formula and it was like"
5740040,5744920,Julia,"What are you... what? Like what are you supposed to do? Okay, die, I guess. Like what?"
5745930,5751730,Jacob,Everyone in chat is saying fed is best and that's right. -You just want them to be fed
5749660,5750790,Julia,Yeah
5752190,5755650,Julia,"like, okay, you tried this thing, it didn't work,"
5756490,5760100,Julia,"We gotta go to option B, it's not like... I don't"
5760880,5771800,Jacob,"I'll tell you right now, Chad, the only breastfeeding I care about for my child is chicken breast and rice and broccoli and hitting the goddamn iron"
5772390,5777470,Jacob,temple and lifting and getting huge. That's all I care about
5778280,5780730,Julia,That's the only thing our child's going to be allowed to eat
5782630,5784300,Julia,they're going to be jacked
5784300,5787100,Jacob,"From day one, day one"
5787100,5793130,Julia,"And then we're going to make them an influencer over it, you know? -We're going to be like, this child is so strong"
5799510,5800350,Julia,James?
5801970,5803170,Julia,You fucking dropped it
5807250,5807980,Julia,James?

5821550,5822240,Jacob,Oh
5823600,5825500,Julia,"Sup, motherfucker?"
5830730,5833770,Julia,I'm obsessed. I'm obsessed with everything that just happened
5833760,5837160,Jacob,That was the most relatable  James has ever been to me
5836210,5836780,Julia,Yeah
5841320,5841970,Julia,Okay
5848410,5850340,Jacob,It's one of the freaking Legulas
5863600,5867210,Julia,"Can I fight this thing or do I have to run? No, I probably gotta fight, huh?"
5869660,5871130,Julia,"No, that's not the weapon I wanted"
5873610,5874870,Julia,That's not the weapon I wanted
5875600,5876930,Julia,Now that's the weapon I wanted
5877890,5880030,Jacob,You need to shoot its ceiling hands
5880490,5881590,Julia,"Oh, probably"
5883510,5884050,Julia,Well
5889430,5889990,Julia,Well
5890410,5892220,Jacob,"It feels like you should, right?"

5932820,5933900,Jacob,Did you get it?
5938290,5939420,Jacob,I think you got it
5940940,5942470,Jacob,"I think we're good, I think we're clear"
5942470,5943670,Julia,Let's take a look
5944300,5945390,Jacob,Take a look
5946240,5947620,Jacob,It's in a book
5948500,5950200,Julia,"Oh, look at them toes"
5950930,5951990,Julia,They're all curled
5953090,5956500,Julia,"Oh, got a lot of blood. Was that me? Did I do that?"
5958080,5962230,Jacob,"And then the mouth, head and mouth hands"
5965150,5965560,Jacob,Oh

5979390,5983020,Julia,"It's not great, man. -It's like certainly not good"
5981450,5984750,Jacob,"It's not good, it's just not good"
5984750,5985760,Julia,Yeah
5989890,5991660,Julia,Although this angle is very funny
5992850,5998180,Jacob,"I want them to sing in like three-part harmony. -Be like, hello, hello, hello"
5998400,6000960,Julia,"What about like the rhythm having like the, oh"

6036990,6039200,Jacob,"Boys, I'm struggling"
6038150,6039490,Julia,"Boys, I'm going through it"
6040500,6042680,Julia,"I'm not going to talk about it though, I don't want to"
6044570,6045110,Julia,Well

6698980,6703520,Julia,sing together
6705360,6708190,Julia,It's like he was forced to make the song
6708930,6710660,Julia,and he did it out of resentment
6712980,6717780,Jacob,The chorus literally sounds like it's a record that's like skipping
6719090,6719840,Julia,Yeah
6720780,6732610,Julia,"My favorite line of that is when he does the second verse and he's already established sort of like the rhythm of the song, and then he goes, oh, that's enough"
6733350,6738180,Julia,"He just like skips a line and just like kind of groans and goes, that's enough"
6739380,6742030,Julia,"Simply, happily"

6762900,6767310,Julia,"Ding dong! Like, ding dong sounds so sarcastic"
6768720,6777160,Julia,"It's like he wrote it and he was hungover and he was like, the freaking church bells, I'm going to lose my mind"

6792650,6797140,Julia,"Holy down the chimney for me, boy boy"
6797820,6806320,Julia,"Scooby-Dooby-Dooby-Doo. It's the fact that the original is kind of sung with like a baby tone, like really... ugh"

6840240,6841790,Jacob,I think Eartha Kitt's great
6842450,6844780,Jacob,But I don't think Santa Baby is great
6849060,6851190,Julia,It was not a judgment on Eartha Kitt
6851190,6854480,Jacob,I can hold two truths in my mind simultaneously
6859850,6862840,Jacob,Do they know it's Christmas time is also atrocious? Yes
6863160,6867680,Julia,That one's atrocious on like a writing level
6867510,6868370,Jacob,Yeah

6900480,6903990,Julia,"You do like have a particular hate,"
6904870,6906800,Julia,for like
6907960,6910050,Julia,sentimental commercials too
6910810,6912330,Jacob,"Yeah, because they haven't earned it"
6912400,6914030,Julia,",Yeah, well, because"
6914030,6920280,Jacob,It feels like they're trying to manipulate me into feeling something so that I buy their fucking folders
6921220,6927480,Jacob,"They don't care if I feel something, they don't care about me. -They're not trying to say something that is true and real"
6927480,6933270,Julia,They're just trying to say you too could have this moment where you don't understand if this person is dating or siblings
6933910,6935580,Julia,"Um, buy this coffee"
6940310,6941640,Julia,I'm just gonna go
6949420,6957200,Julia,"Yeah, and then every iteration of Santa Baby, I don't like. -Like no one's improved on it. -No. -And that's like truly when you know,"
6954700,6955070,Jacob,No
6957960,6964570,Julia,"You know a song is bad for two reasons. One, a legendary singer sung it and it's bad and you still don't like it"
6965220,6970240,Julia,And other people have tried their takes on it and none of them have worked for you
6974990,6975970,Julia,I also want to say
6977480,6978580,Julia,If you like
6979810,6981030,Julia,Santa baby
6981030,6982070,Jacob,Then get out!
6983290,6986460,Julia,You're fine to have that opinion?
6985940,6987000,Jacob,You're a pervert
6987000,6988450,Julia,I just want to know
6988100,6989670,Jacob,You're a nasty little freak
6989670,6990980,Julia,You've ruined my bit
6990980,6994270,Jacob,"Sorry, I thought I was trying to like do a bit with you"
6995440,7002290,Julia,"Well, I was going to go on like a whole thing about how you're like fine to have your opinions, but you're stupid for having it"
7003200,7008110,Julia,"but then you just said that they were stupid throughout the whole thing, and now I just feel like I'm bullying"
7009560,7013700,Jacob,I... there was a misinterpret. Can I tell you what happened?
7012650,7014260,Julia,"Yeah,"
7014910,7017680,Jacob,"I thought that you were going to say,"
7018000,7019860,Julia,Something sincere like I usually do?
7018930,7025440,Jacob,Something sincere like you usually do like that it is fine to like something that we don't like and you know all that kind of thing
7025440,7026940,Julia,"because that's normally what I would say, yeah"
7026840,7034980,Jacob,"That's normally what you would say. -And so I was like, it would be funny if I interspersed your sincere thing with being needlessly antagonistic"
7035720,7041760,Jacob,"And then we'd be going back and forth with you sincere, me antagonistic. -I didn't realize you were doing an inversion on the formula"
7041760,7042840,Julia,"Yeah, yeah"
7042590,7044980,Jacob,And so I played in the wrong space
7044980,7047500,Julia,"No, I understand where the miscommunication was"
7047500,7049030,Jacob,"And for that, I apologize"
7048830,7050380,Julia,I'm just saying you're an asshole
7050760,7051720,Jacob,I
7054570,7056900,Jacob,am going to resign
7060760,7062380,Jacob,I'm going to resign
7062380,7063720,Julia,Normally
7064660,7066700,Julia,"Normally, that is the bit that I do"
7068540,7069670,Julia,Just sometimes
7068860,7073180,Jacob,"Well, it's not even a bit, you just don't want people to feel bad, which is nice"
7070570,7071260,Julia,Yeah
7073180,7073910,Julia,Yeah
7074900,7077100,Julia,"Um, I do"
7078190,7080590,Julia,"I am trying to play with it though, you know?"
7080560,7081320,Jacob,Yeah
7083090,7083930,Julia,Interesting
7085840,7087170,Julia,This game sucks
7088890,7090430,Julia,How did they invent this game?
7091470,7094040,Jacob,D and D? Just roll a 20
7095900,7096860,Jacob,Get a crit
7096860,7101770,Julia,"Wait, like my problem is that I can't see which one's being highlighted a lot of the time"
7104690,7104890,Julia,I'm sorry
7104890,7106410,Jacob,What are we trying to make here?
7106860,7108370,Julia,The thing that's on the wall
7110260,7110970,Julia,Sorry
7111860,7114610,Julia,It's like people in a boat and then the reflection of the boat
7115120,7116350,Julia,is how I'm seeing it
7118090,7119300,Jacob,"All right, just make that"
7119600,7120430,Julia,Okay
7121560,7122980,Julia,"OK, so that one's right"
7121650,7123030,Jacob,"Yeah, that goes there"
7123760,7130030,Jacob,"And then that one goes on the top. -Red goes on top, yeah, yeah, yeah. -Yes, yes, yes"
7128380,7129160,Julia,Yes!
7131840,7133680,Jacob,7414

7241640,7244180,Julia,"Oh, I thought I could watch the VHS tape here"
7244770,7245910,Julia,That was my mistake
7245680,7248180,Jacob,Why would you think that because there's a TV that's on?
7248180,7250450,Julia,And that's like making noise actively

7372430,7372930,Julia,Ah
7374170,7376380,Julia,I was hoping they wouldn't scream
7378450,7380640,Julia,I'm getting reckless because I
7384170,7386600,Julia,I just... I'm like taking shortcuts now
7389060,7390330,Jacob,"Go ahead, James"
7392610,7394130,Jacob,He's pumping the valve
7398250,7399780,Jacob,He's really slow at it

7417700,7419390,Jacob,So we ain't finishing it now

7436420,7437510,Julia,It's pretty
7438560,7439640,Julia,Pretty high
7440900,7442420,Jacob,Every time I'm holding
7443080,7447770,Jacob,our car keys slash apartment keys and we get in the elevator in our building
7448650,7452410,Jacob,I'm like gripping those things so tight because there's like a crack this big
7453110,7453680,Julia,Yeah
7453480,7456250,Jacob,between the elevator and the floor
7456250,7457020,Julia,Yeah
7456850,7459180,Jacob,"And I'm like, one false move"
7460750,7470640,Jacob,"And I drop those keys. -If I drop the keys, they're going right in there. -I know that for a fact. -They will not bounce. -They will nothing but net in the crack and be gone forever"
